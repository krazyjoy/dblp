iccvw_2023_1,Polygon Detection for Room Layout Estimation using Heterogeneous Graphs and Wireframes.,"This paper presents a neural network based semantic plane detection method utilizing polygon representations. The method can for example be used to solve room layout estimations tasks and is built on, combines and further develops several different modules from previous research. The network takes an RGB image and estimates a wireframe as well as a feature space using an hourglass backbone. From these, line and junction features are sampled. The lines and junctions are then represented as an undirected graph, from which polygon representations of the sought planes are obtained. Two different methods for this last step are investigated, where the most promising method is built on a heterogeneous graph transformer. The final output is in all cases a projection of the semantic planes in 2D. The methods are evaluated on the Structured3D dataset and we investigate the performance both using sampled and estimated wireframes. The experiments show the potential of the graph-based method by outperforming state of the art methods in Room Layout estimation in the 2D metrics using synthetic wireframe detections.",No
iccvw_2023_2,Fine-Grained is Too Coarse: A Novel Data-Centric Approach for Efficient Scene Graph Generation.,"Learning to compose visual relationships from raw images in the form of scene graphs is a highly challenging task due to contextual dependencies, but it is essential in computer vision applications that depend on scene understanding. However, no current approaches in Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aim at providing useful graphs for downstream tasks. Instead, the main focus has primarily been on the task of unbiasing the data distribution for predicting more fine-grained relations. That being said, all fine-grained relations are not equally relevant and at least a part of them are of no use for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce the task of Efficient SGG that prioritizes the generation of relevant relations, facilitating the use of Scene Graphs in downstream tasks such as Image Generation. To support further approaches, we present a new dataset, VG150-curated, based on the annotations of the popular Visual Genome dataset. We show through a set of experiments that this dataset contains more high-quality and diverse annotations than the one usually use in SGG. Finally, we show the efficiency of this dataset in the task of Image Generation from Scene Graphs1.",No
iccvw_2023_3,Knowledge Informed Sequential Scene Graph Verification Using VQA.,"We propose a new task, non localized scene graph verification, whose objective is to provide a justified expression of inconsistencies between the visual content of the image and its non-localized scene graph in order to diagnose errors or anticipate corrections. We introduce a sequential algorithm capable of detecting and proposing plausible corrections, taking into account the information already present in the scene graph and exploiting knowledge priors. Instead of relying on object detection that requires bounding box annotations, we use a simple visual question answering (VQA) as a proxy for visual content analysis. We show on the VG150 dataset that our strategy is efficient compared to a baseline adapted from a caption editing approach. We also show that our algorithm is able to efficiently correct corrupted scene graphs.",No
iccvw_2023_4,DeepCut: Unsupervised Segmentation using Graph Neural Networks Clustering.,"Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Data annotation for training supervised methods can be labor-intensive, motivating unsupervised methods. Current approaches often rely on extracting deep features from pre-trained networks to construct a graph, and classical clustering methods like k-means and normalized-cuts are then applied as a post-processing step. However, this approach reduces the high-dimensional information encoded in the features to pair-wise scalar affinities. To address this limitation, this study introduces a lightweight Graph Neural Network (GNN) to replace classical clustering methods while optimizing for the same clustering objective function. Unlike existing methods, our GNN takes both the pair-wise affinities between local image features and the raw features as input. This direct connection between the raw features and the clustering objective enables us to implicitly perform classification of the clusters between different graphs, resulting in part semantic segmentation without the need for additional post-processing steps. We demonstrate how classical clustering objectives can be formulated as self-supervised loss functions for training an image segmentation GNN. Furthermore, we employ the Correlation-Clustering (CC) objective to perform clustering without defining the number of clusters, allowing for k-less clustering. We apply the proposed method for object localization, segmentation, and semantic part segmentation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks1.",No
iccvw_2023_5,nuScenes Knowledge Graph - A comprehensive semantic representation of traffic scenes for trajectory prediction.,"Trajectory prediction in traffic scenes involves accurately forecasting the behaviour of surrounding vehicles. To achieve this objective it is crucial to consider contextual information, including the driving path of vehicles, road topology, lane dividers, and traffic rules. Although studies demonstrated the potential of leveraging heterogeneous context for improving trajectory prediction, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches still rely on a limited subset of this information. This is mainly due to the limited availability of comprehensive representations. This paper presents an approach that utilizes knowledge graphs to model the diverse entities and their semantic connections within traffic scenes. Further, we present nuScenes Knowledge Graph (nSKG), a knowledge graph for the nuScenes dataset, that models explicitly all scene participants and road elements, as well as their semantic and spatial relationships. To facilitate the usage of the nSKG via graph neural networks for trajectory prediction, we provide the data in a format, ready-to-use by the PyGlibrary.

iccvw_2023_6,Relational Prior Knowledge Graphs for Detection and Instance Segmentation.,"Humans have a remarkable ability to perceive and reason about the world around them by understanding the relationships between objects. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using such relationships for object detection and instance segmentation. To this end, we propose a Relational Prior-based Feature Enhancement Model (RP-FEM), a graph transformer that enhances object proposal features using relational priors. The proposed architecture operates on top of scene graphs obtained from initial proposals and aims to concurrently learn relational context modeling for object detection and instance segmentation.Experimental evaluations on COCO show that the utilization of scene graphs, augmented with relational priors, offer benefits for object detection and instance segmentation. RP-FEM demonstrates its capacity to suppress improbable class predictions within the image while also preventing the model from generating duplicate predictions, leading to improvements over the baseline model on which it is built.",No
iccvw_2023_7,Haystack: A Panoptic Scene Graph Dataset to Evaluate Rare Predicate Classes.,"Current scene graph datasets suffer from strong long-tail distributions of their predicate classes. Due to a very low number of some predicate classes in the test sets, no reliable metrics can be retrieved for the rarest classes. We construct a new panoptic scene graph dataset and a set of metrics that are designed as a benchmark for the predictive performance especially on rare predicate classes. To construct the new dataset, we propose a model-assisted annotation pipeline that efficiently finds rare predicate classes that are hidden in a large set of images like needles in a haystack.Contrary to prior scene graph datasets, Haystack contains explicit negative annotations, i.e. annotations that a given relation does not have a certain predicate class. Negative annotations are helpful especially in the field of scene graph generation and open up a whole new set of possibilities to improve current scene graph generation models.Haystack is 100% compatible with existing panoptic scene graph datasets and can easily be integrated with existing evaluation pipelines. Our dataset and code can be found here: https://lorjul.github.io/haystack/. It includes annotation files and simple to use scripts and utilities, to help with integrating our dataset in existing work.",No
iccvw_2023_8,Exploring the Road Graph in Trajectory Forecasting for Autonomous Driving.,"As Deep Learning tackles complex tasks like trajectory forecasting in autonomous vehicles, a number of new challenges emerge. In particular, autonomous driving requires accounting for vast a priori knowledge in the form of HDMaps. Graph representations have emerged as the most convenient representation for this complex information. Nevertheless, little work has gone into studying how this road graph should be constructed and how it influences forecasting solutions. In this paper, we explore the impact of spatial resolution, the graphâ€™s relation to trajectory outputs and how knowledge can be embedded into the graph. To this end, we propose thorough experiments for 2 graph-based frameworks (PGP [6], LAformer [14]) over the nuScenes [1] dataset, with additional experiments on the LaneGCN [13] framework and Argoverse 1.1 [2] dataset.",No
iccvw_2023_9,Dynamic Scene Graph Representation for Surgical Video.,"Surgical videos captured from microscopic or endoscopic imaging devices are rich but complex sources of information, depicting different tools and anatomical structures utilized during an extended amount of time. Despite containing crucial workflow information and being commonly recorded in many procedures, usage of surgical videos for automated surgical workflow understanding is still limited. In this work, we exploit scene graphs as a more holistic, semantically meaningful and human-readable way to represent surgical videos while encoding all anatomical structures, tools, and their interactions. To properly evaluate the impact of our solutions, we create a scene graph dataset from semantic segmentations from the CaDIS and CATARACTS datasets. We demonstrate that scene graphs can be leveraged through the use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to tackle surgical downstream tasks such as surgical workflow recognition with competitive performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the benefits of surgical scene graphs regarding the explainability and robustness of model decisions, which are crucial in the clinical setting.",No
iccvw_2023_10,SceneGenie: Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Models for Image Synthesis.,"Text-conditioned image generation has made significant progress in recent years with generative adversarial networks and more recently, diffusion models. While diffusion models conditioned on text prompts have produced impressive and high-quality images, accurately representing complex text prompts such as the number of instances of a specific object remains challenging.To address this limitation, we propose a novel guidance approach for the sampling process in the diffusion model that leverages bounding box and segmentation map information at inference time without additional training data. Through a novel loss in the sampling process, our approach guides the model with semantic features from CLIP embeddings and enforces geometric constraints, leading to high-resolution images that accurately represent the scene. To obtain bounding box and segmentation map information, we structure the text prompt as a scene graph and enrich the nodes with CLIP embeddings. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks for image generation from scene graphs, surpassing both scene graph to image and text-based diffusion models in various metrics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating bounding box and segmentation map guidance in the diffusion model sampling process for more accurate text-to-image generation.

iccvw_2023_11,Padding Aware Neurons.,"Convolutional layers are a fundamental component of most image-related models. These layers often implement by default a static padding policy (e.g. zero padding), to control the scale of the internal representations, and to allow kernel activations centered on the border regions. In this work we identify Padding Aware Neurons (PANs), a type of filter that is found in most (if not all) convolutional models trained with static padding. PANs focus on the characterization and recognition of input border location, introducing a spatial inductive bias into the model (e.g. how close to the inputâ€™s border a pattern typically is). We propose a method to identify PANs through their activations, and explore their presence in several popular pre-trained models, finding PANs on all models explored, from dozens to hundreds. We discuss and illustrate different types of PANs, their kernels and behaviour. To understand their relevance, we test their impact on model performance, and find padding and PANs to induce strong and characteristic biases in the data. Finally, we discuss whether or not PANs are desirable, as well as the potential side effects of their presence in the context of model performance, generalisation, efficiency and safety.",No
iccvw_2023_12,Geometric Superpixel Representations for Efficient Image Classification with Graph Neural Networks.,"While Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers are the go-to solutions for image classification, their model sizes make them expensive to train and deploy. Alternatively, input complexity can be reduced following the intuition that adjacent similar pixels contain redundant information. This prior can be exploited by clustering such pixels into superpixels and connecting adjacent superpixels with edges, resulting in a sparse graph representation on which Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can operate efficiently. Although previous work clearly highlights the computational efficiency of this approach, this prior can be overly restrictive and, as a result, performance is lacking compared to contemporary dense vision methods. In this work, we propose to extend this prior by incorporating shape information into the individual super-pixel representations. This is achieved through a separate, patch-level GNN. Together with enriching the previously explored appearance and pose information of superpixels and further architectural changes, our best model, ShapeGNN, surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in superpixel-based image classification on CIFAR-10 by a significant margin. We also present an optimised pipeline for efficient image-to-graph transformation and show the viability of training end-to-end on high-resolution images on ImageNet-1k.1",No
iccvw_2023_13,Using and Abusing Equivariance.,"In this paper we show how Group Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks use subsampling to learn to break equivariance to the rotation and reflection symmetries. We focus on the 2D rotations and reflections and investigate the impact of the broken equivariance on network performance. We show that a change in the input dimension of a network as small as a single pixel can be enough for commonly used architectures to become approximately equivariant, rather than exactly. We investigate the impact of networks not being exactly equivariant and find that approximately equivariant networks generalise significantly worse to unseen symmetries compared to their exactly equivariant counterparts. However, when the symmetries in the training data are not identical to the symmetries of the network, we find that approximately equivariant networks can relax their equivariance constraints, matching or outperforming exactly equivariant networks on common benchmarks.",No
iccvw_2023_14,DFM-X: Augmentation by Leveraging Prior Knowledge of Shortcut Learning.,"Neural networks are prone to learn easy solutions from superficial statistics in the data, namely shortcut learning, which impairs generalization and robustness of models. We propose a data augmentation strategy, named DFM-X, that leverages knowledge about frequency shortcuts, encoded in Dominant Frequencies Maps computed for image classification models. We randomly select X% training images of certain classes for augmentation, and process them by retaining the frequencies included in the DFMs of other classes. This strategy compels the models to leverage a broader range of frequencies for classification, rather than relying on specific frequency sets. Thus, the models learn more deep and task-related semantics compared to their counterpart trained with standard setups. Unlike other commonly used augmentation techniques which focus on increasing the visual variations of training data, our method targets exploiting the original data efficiently, by distilling prior knowledge about destructive learning behavior of models from data. Our experimental results demonstrate that DFM-X improves robustness against common corruptions and adversarial attacks. It can be seamlessly integrated with other augmentation techniques to further enhance the robustness of models. Codes are available at https://github.com/nis-research/dfmX-augmentation.",Yes
iccvw_2023_15,No Data Augmentation? Alternative Regularizations for Effective Training on Small Datasets.,"Solving image classification tasks given small training datasets remains an open challenge for modern computer vision. Aggressive data augmentation and generative models are among the most straightforward approaches to overcoming the lack of data. However, the first fails to be agnostic to varying image domains, while the latter requires additional compute and careful design.In this work, we study alternative regularization strategies to push the limits of supervised learning on small image classification datasets. In particular, along with the model size and training schedule scaling, we employ a heuristic to select (semi) optimal learning rate and weight decay couples via the norm of model parameters. By training on only 1% of the original CIFAR-10 training set (i.e., 50 images per class) and testing on ciFAIR-10, a variant of the original CIFAR without duplicated images, we reach a test accuracy of 66.5%, on par with the best state-of-the-art methods.",No
iccvw_2023_16,COSE: A Consistency-Sensitivity Metric for Saliency on Image Classification.,"We present a set of metrics that utilize vision priors to effectively assess the performance of saliency methods on image classification tasks. To understand behavior in deep learning models, many methods provide visual saliency maps emphasizing image regions that most contribute to a model prediction. However, there is limited work on analyzing the reliability of saliency methods in explaining model decisions. We propose the metric COnsistency-SEnsitivity (COSE) that quantifies the equivariant and invariant properties of visual model explanations using simple data augmentations. Through our metrics, we show that although saliency methods are thought to be architecture-independent, most methods could better explain transformer-based models over convolutional-based models. In addition, GradCAM was found to outperform other methods in terms of COSE but was shown to have limitations such as lack of variability for fine-grained datasets. The duality between consistency and sensitivity allow the analysis of saliency methods from different angles. Ultimately, we find that it is important to balance these two metrics for a saliency map to faithfully show model behavior.",No
iccvw_2023_17,Video BagNet: short temporal receptive fields increase robustness in long-term action recognition.,"Previous work on long-term video action recognition relies on deep 3D-convolutional models that have a large temporal receptive field (RF). We argue that these models are not always the best choice for temporal modeling in videos. A large temporal receptive field allows the model to encode the exact sub-action order of a video, which causes a performance decrease when testing videos have a different sub-action order. In this work, we investigate whether we can improve the model robustness to the sub-action order by shrinking the temporal receptive field of action recognition models. For this, we design Video BagNet, a variant of the 3D ResNet-50 model with the temporal receptive field size limited to 1, 9, 17 or 33 frames. We analyze Video Bag-Net on synthetic and real-world video datasets and experimentally compare models with varying temporal receptive fields. We find that short receptive fields are robust to sub-action order changes, while larger temporal receptive fields are sensitive to the sub-action order.",No
iccvw_2023_18,PARTICLE: Part Discovery and Contrastive Learning for Fine-grained Recognition.,"We develop techniques for refining representations for fine-grained classification and segmentation tasks in a self-supervised manner. We find that fine-tuning methods based on instance-discriminative contrastive learning are not as effective, and posit that recognizing part-specific variations is crucial for fine-grained categorization. We present an iterative learning approach that incorporates part-centric equivariance and invariance objectives. First, pixel representations are clustered to discover parts. We analyze the representations from convolutional and vision transformer networks that are best suited for this task. Then, a part-centric learning step aggregates and contrasts representations of parts within an image. We show that this improves the performance on image classification and part segmentation tasks across datasets. For example, under a linear-evaluation scheme, the classification accuracy of a ResNet50 trained on ImageNet using DetCon [17], a self-supervised learning approach, improves from 35.4% to 42.0% on the Caltech-UCSD Birds, from 35.5% to 44.1% on the FGVC Aircraft, and from 29.7% to 37.4% on the Stanford Cars. We also observe significant gains in few-shot part segmentation tasks using the proposed technique, while instance-discriminative learning was not as effective. Smaller, yet consistent, improvements are also observed for stronger networks based on transformers.",No
iccvw_2023_19,Self-supervised Learning of Contextualized Local Visual Embeddings.,"We present Contextualized Local Visual Embeddings (CLoVE), a self-supervised convolutional-based method that learns representations suited for dense prediction tasks. CLoVE deviates from current methods and optimizes a single loss function that operates at the level of contextualized local embeddings learned from output feature maps of convolution neural network (CNN) encoders. To learn contextualized embeddings, CLoVE proposes a normalized mult-head self-attention layer that combines local features from different parts of an image based on similarity. We extensively benchmark CLoVEâ€™s pre-trained representations on multiple datasets. CLoVE reaches state-of-the-art performance for CNN-based architectures in 4 dense prediction downstream tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, keypoint detection, and dense pose estimation. Code: https://github.com/sthalles/CLoVE.",No
iccvw_2023_20,DeepVAT: A Self-Supervised Technique for Cluster Assessment in Image Datasets.,"Estimating the number of clusters and cluster structures in unlabeled, complex, and high-dimensional datasets (like images) is challenging for traditional clustering algorithms. In recent years, a matrix reordering-based algorithm called Visual Assessment of Tendency (VAT), and its variants have attracted many researchers from various domains to estimate the number of clusters and inherent cluster structure present in the data. However, these algorithms face significant challenges when dealing with image data as they fail to effectively capture the crucial features inherent in images. To overcome these limitations, we propose a deep-learning-based framework that enables the assessment of cluster structure in complex image datasets. Our approach utilizes a self-supervised deep neural network to generate representative embeddings for the data. These embeddings are then reduced to 2-dimension using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) and inputted into VAT based algorithms to estimate the underlying cluster structure. Importantly, our framework does not rely on any prior knowledge of the number of clusters. Our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art VAT family algorithms and two other deep clustering algorithms on four benchmark image datasets, namely MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and INTEL.",No.
iccvw_2023_21,RV-VAE: Integrating Random Variable Algebra into Variational Autoencoders.,"Among deep generative models, variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a central approach in generating new samples from a learned, latent space while effectively reconstructing input data. The original formulation requires a stochastic sampling operation, implemented via the reparameterization trick, to approximate a posterior latent distribution. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the full distributions of encoded input to optimize the model over the entire range of the data, instead of discrete samples. We treat the encoded distributions as continuous random variables and use operations defined by the algebra of random variables during decoding. This approach integrates an innate mathematical prior into the model, helping to improve data efficiency and reduce computational load. Experimental results across different datasets and architectures confirm that this modification enhances VAE-based architecturesâ€™ performance. Specifically, our approach improves the reconstruction error and generative capabilities of several VAE architectures, as measured by the FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric, while exhibiting similar or better training convergence behavior. Our method exemplifies the power of combining deep learning with inductive priors, promoting data efficiency and less reliance on brute-force learning.

iccvw_2023_22,Geometric Contrastive Learning.,"Contrastive learning has been a long-standing research area due to its versatility and importance in learning representations. Recent works have shown improved results if the learned representations are constrained to be on a hypersphere. However, this prior geometric constraint is not fully utilized during training. In this work, we propose making use of geodesic distances on the hypersphere to learn contrasts between representations. Through empirical results, we show that this contrastive learning approach improves downstream tasks across different contrastive learning frameworks. We show that having geometric inductive priors perform even better in contrastive learning if used along with other correct geometric information.",No
iccvw_2023_23,Good Fences Make Good Neighbours.,"Neighbour contrastive learning enhances the common contrastive learning methods by introducing neighbour representations to the training of pretext tasks. These algorithms are highly dependent on the retrieved neighbours and therefore require careful neighbour extraction in order to avoid learning irrelevant representations. Potential ""Bad"" Neighbours in contrastive tasks introduce representations that are less informative and, consequently, hold back the capacity of the model making it less useful as a good prior. In this work, we present a simple yet effective neighbour contrastive SSL framework, called ""Mending Neighbours"" which identifies potential bad neighbours and replaces them with a novel augmented representation called ""Bridge Points"". The Bridge Points are generated in the latent space by interpolating the neighbour and query representations in a completely unsupervised way. We highlight that by careful selection and replacement of neighbours, the model learns better representations. Our proposed method outperforms the most popular neighbour contrastive approach, NNCLR, on three different benchmark datasets in the linear evaluation downstream task. Finally, we perform an in-depth three-fold analysis (quantitative, qualitative and ablation) to further support the importance of proper neighbour selection in contrastive learning algorithms.",No
iccvw_2023_24,Data Efficient Single Image Dehazing via Adversarial Auto-Augmentation and extended Atmospheric Scattering Model.,"Supervised learning-based image dehazing algorithms are sensitive to degradation and training distribution, making them ill-suited for out-of-domain non-uniform restoration. We propose an adversarial auto-augmentation approach to address this limitation without explicitly collecting paired training data. Specifically, we generate images with a broad distribution representative of multiple domains by varying the degradation and color profiles achieved by leveraging new augmentation techniques, including mean-variance transfer, physically accurate atmospheric scattering model, and localized degradation generation. These techniques effectively account for non-homogeneous degradations, enhancing the robustness of the underlying degradation model. Apart from utilizing these synthetic negative images to train the underlying network, these also provide diverse image representations for enabling more effective contrastive regularization. In addition to the training modifications, we propose a frequency-based feature fusion mechanism that prioritizes semantic and structural information from the decoder and encoder. Finally, we incorporate depth and color attenuation priors to ensure perceptually pleasing and physically accurate restoration quality. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism, we perform comprehensive experiments and obtain state-of-the-art (SoTA) results while achieving high fidelity and improving the performance of perception-based algorithms without fine tuning.",No
iccvw_2023_25,Distilling Part-whole Hierarchical Knowledge from a Huge Pretrained Class Agnostic Segmentation Framework.,"We propose a novel approach for distilling visual knowledge from a large-scale pre-trained segmentation model, namely, the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our goal is to pre-train the Agglomerator, a recently introduced column-style network architecture inspired by the organization of neurons in the Neocortex, to learn part-whole hierarchies in images. Despite its biological plausibility, we find that the original pre-training strategy of the Agglomerator, using supervised contrastive loss, fails to work effectively with natural images. To address this, we introduce a new pre-training strategy that aims to instill the model with prior knowledge of the compositional nature of our world. Our approach involves dividing the input image into patches and using the center point of each patch to generate segmentation masks through SAM. SAM produces three results per point to handle ambiguity at the whole, part, and sub-part levels. We then train a simple encoder to utilize the intermediate feature maps of the Agglomerator and reconstruct the embeddings of the masks. This forces the networkâ€™s intermediate features to learn objects and their constituent parts. By employing our pre-training strategy, we significantly enhance the classification performance on Imagenette, achieving an accuracy improvement from 58.6% to 91.2% without relying on any augmentation. Remarkably, we achieve this with a minimal parameter count of only 3.2 million, which is approximately 54 times smaller than the originally proposed Agglomerator. These results demonstrate both exceptional data and resource efficiency. Our code is available at: https://github.com/AhmedMostafaSoliman/distill-part-whole",No
iccvw_2023_26,Logarithm-transform aided Gaussian Sampling for Few-Shot Learning.,"Few-shot image classification has recently witnessed the rise of representation learning being utilised for models to adapt to new classes using only a few training examples. Therefore, the properties of the representations, such as their underlying probability distributions, assume vital importance. Representations sampled from Gaussian distributions have been used in recent works, [19] to train classifiers for few-shot classification. These methods rely on transforming the distributions of experimental data to approximate Gaussian distributions for their functioning. In this paper, I propose a novel Gaussian transform, that outperforms existing methods on transforming experimental data into Gaussian-like distributions. I then utilise this novel transformation for few-shot image classification and show significant gains in performance, while sampling lesser data.",No
iccvw_2023_27,InterAug: A Tuning-Free Augmentation Policy for Data-Efficient and Robust Object Detection.,"The recent progress in developing pre-trained models, trained on large-scale datasets, has highlighted the need for robust protocols to effectively adapt them to domain-specific data, especially when there is a limited amount of available data. Data augmentations can play a critical role in enabling data-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained object detection models. Choosing the right augmentation policy for a given dataset is challenging and relies on knowledge about task-relevant invariances. In this work, we focus on an understudied aspect of this problem â€“ can bounding box annotations be used to design more effective augmentation policies? Through InterAug, we make a critical finding that, we can leverage the annotations to infer the effective context for each object in a scene, as opposed to manipulating the entire scene or only within the pre-specified bounding boxes. Using a rigorous empirical study with multiple benchmarks and architectures, we demonstrate the efficacy of InterAug in improving robustness and handling data scarcity. Finally, InterAug can be used with any off-the-shelf policy, does not require any modification to the architecture, and significantly outperforms existing protocols. Our codes can be found at https://github.com/kowshikthopalli/InterAug.",No
iccvw_2023_28,Enhancing CLIP with GPT-4: Harnessing Visual Descriptions as Prompts.,"Contrastive pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have revolutionized visual representation learning by providing good performance on downstream datasets. VLMs are 0-shot adapted to a downstream dataset by designing prompts that are relevant to the dataset. Such prompt engineering makes use of domain expertise and a validation dataset. Meanwhile, recent developments in generative pretrained models like GPT-4 mean they can be used as advanced internet search tools. They can also be manipulated to provide visual information in any structure. In this work, we show that GPT-4 can be used to generate text that is visually descriptive and how this can be used to adapt CLIP to downstream tasks. We show considerable improvements in 0-shot transfer accuracy on specialized fine-grained datasets like EuroSAT (~7%), DTD (~ 7%), SUN397 (~ 4.6%), and CUB ( ~3.3%) when compared to CLIPâ€™s default prompt. We also design a simple few-shot adapter that learns to choose the best possible sentences to construct generalizable classifiers that outperform the recently proposed CoCoOP by ~2% on average and by over 4% on 4 specialized fine-grained datasets. The code, prompts, and auxiliary text dataset is available at github.com/mayug/VDT-Adapter.",No
iccvw_2023_29,Retrieving-to-Answer: Zero-Shot Video Question Answering with Frozen Large Language Models.,"Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has been significantly advanced from the scaling of recent Large Language Models (LLMs). The key idea is to convert the visual information into the language feature space so that the capacity of LLMs can be fully exploited. Existing VideoQA methods typically take two paradigms: (1) learning cross-modal alignment, and (2) using an off-the-shelf captioning model to describe the visual data. However, the first design needs costly training on many extra multi-modal data, whilst the second is further limited by limited domain generalization. To address these limitations, a simple yet effective Retrieving-to-Answer (R2A) framework is proposed. Given an input video, R2A first retrieves a set of semantically similar texts from a generic text corpus using a pre-trained multi-modal model (e.g., CLIP). With both the question and the retrieved texts, a LLM (e.g., DeBERTa) can be directly used to yield a desired answer. Without the need for cross-modal fine-tuning, R2A allows for all the key components (e.g., LLM, retrieval model, and text corpus) to plug-and-play. Extensive experiments on several VideoQA benchmarks show that despite with 1.3B parameters and no fine-tuning, our R2A can outperform the 61Ã— larger Flamingo-80B model [1] even additionally trained on nearly 2.1B multi-modal data.",No
iccvw_2023_30,Interaction-Aware Prompting for Zero-Shot Spatio-Temporal Action Detection.,"The goal of spatial-temporal action detection is to determine the time and place where each personâ€™s action occurs in a video and classify the corresponding action category. Most of the existing methods adopt fully-supervised learning, which requires a large amount of training data, making it very difficult to achieve zero-shot learning. In this paper, we propose to utilize a pre-trained visual-language model to extract the representative image and text features, and model the relationship between these features through different interaction modules to obtain the interaction feature. In addition, we use this feature to prompt each label to obtain more appropriate text feature. Finally, we calculate the similarity between the interaction feature and the text feature for each label to determine the action category. Our experiments on J-HMDB and UCF101-24 datasets demonstrate that the proposed interaction module and prompting make the visual-language features better aligned, thus achieving excellent accuracy for zero-shot spatio-temporal action detection. The code will be available at https://github.com/webber2933/iCLIP.",No
iccvw_2023_31,ClipCrop: Conditioned Cropping Driven by Vision-Language Model.,"Image cropping has progressed tremendously under the data-driven paradigm. However, current approaches do not account for the intentions of the user, which is an issue especially when the composition of the input image is complex. Moreover, labeling of cropping data is costly and hence the amount of data is limited, leading to poor generalization performance of current algorithms in the wild. In this work, we take advantage of vision-language models as a foundation for creating robust and user-intentional cropping algorithms. By adapting a transformer decoder with a pre-trained CLIP-based detection model, OWL-ViT, we develop a method to perform cropping with a text or image query that reflects the userâ€™s intention as guidance. In addition, our pipeline design allows the model to learn text-conditioned aesthetic cropping with a small cropping dataset, while inheriting the open-vocabulary ability acquired from millions of text-image pairs. We validate our model through extensive experiments on existing datasets as well as a new cropping test set we compiled that is characterized by content ambiguity.",No
iccvw_2023_32,Painter: Teaching Auto-regressive Language Models to Draw Sketches.,"Large language models (LLMs) have made tremendous progress in natural language understanding and they have also been successfully adopted in other domains such as computer vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, etc. In this work, we apply LLMs to image generation tasks by directly generating the virtual brush strokes to paint an image. We present Painter, an LLM that can convert user prompts in text description format to sketches by generating the corresponding brush strokes in an auto-regressive way. We construct Painter based on off-the-shelf LLM that is pre-trained on a large text corpus, by fine-tuning it on the new task while preserving language understanding capabilities. We create a dataset of diverse multi-object sketches paired with textual prompts that covers several object types and tasks. Painter can generate sketches from text descriptions, remove objects from canvas, and detect and classify objects in sketches. Although this is an unprecedented pioneering work in using LLMs for auto-regressive image generation, the results are very encouraging.",No
iccvw_2023_33,Video Attribute Prototype Network: A New Perspective for Zero-Shot Video Classification.,"Video attributes, which leverage video contents to instantiate class semantics, play a critical role in diversifying semantics in zero-shot video classification, thereby facilitating semantic transfer from seen to unseen classes. However, few presences discuss video attributes, and most methods consider class names as class semantics that tend to be loosely defined. In this paper, we propose a Video Attribute Prototype Network (VAPNet) to generate video attributes that learns in-context semantics between video captions and class semantics. Specifically, we introduce a cross-attention module in the Transformer decoder by considering video captions as queries to probe and pool semantic-associated class-wise features. To alleviate noises in pre-extracted captions, we learn caption features through a stochastic representation derived from a Gaussian representation where the variance encodes uncertainties. We utilize a joint video-to-attribute and video-to-video contrastive loss to calibrate visual and semantic features. Experiments show that VAPNet significantly outperforms SoTA by relative improvements of 14.3% on UCF101 and 8.8% on HMDB51, and further surpasses the pre-trained vision-language SoTA by 4.1% and 17.2%.

iccvw_2023_34,Video-and-Language (VidL) models and their cognitive relevance.,"In this paper we give a narrative review of multi-modal video-language (VidL) models. We introduce the current landscape of VidL models and benchmarks, and draw inspiration from neuroscience and cognitive science to propose avenues for future research in VidL models in particular and artificial intelligence (AI) in general. We argue that iterative feedback loops between AI, neuroscience, and cognitive science are essential to spur progress across these disciplines. We motivate why we focus specifically on VidL models and their benchmarks as a promising type of model to bring improvements in AI and categorise current VidL efforts across multiple â€˜cognitive relevance axiomsâ€™. Finally, we provide suggestions on how to effectively incorporate this interdisciplinary viewpoint into research on VidL models in particular and AI in general. In doing so, we hope to create awareness of the potential of VidL models to narrow the gap between neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI.",No
iccvw_2023_35,Towards an Exhaustive Evaluation of Vision-Language Foundation Models.,"Vision-language foundation models have had considerable increase in performances in the last few years. However, there is still a lack comprehensive evaluation methods able to clearly explain their performances. We argue that a more systematic approach to foundation model evaluation would be beneficial to their use in real-world applications. In particular, we think that those models should be evaluated on a broad range of precise capabilities, in order to bring awareness to the width of their scope and their potential weaknesses. To that end, we propose a methodology to build a taxonomy of multimodal capabilities for vision-language foundation models. The proposed taxonomy is intended as a first step towards an exhaustive evaluation of vision-language foundation models.",No
iccvw_2023_36,Coarse to Fine Frame Selection for Online Open-ended Video Question Answering.,"The central aim of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is to provide answers to questions posed in natural language, relying on the content of the given videos. However, when applied to video streams like CCTV recordings and live broadcasts, the solver encounters more intricate challenges. In such scenarios, the segment of the video needed to answer a specific question is often a small component of the entire video. To address these complexities, a recent and innovative problem domain called Online Open-ended Video Question Answering (O2VQA) has been introduced[18].In this paper, we propose an architecture based on multi-modal foundational transformers for the O2VQA task. The architecture comprises three modules. The first module is responsible for the coarse selection of the target video segment relevant to answering the question. The second module refines this coarse segment by leveraging a Temporal Concept Spotting mechanism, enabling the capture of temporal saliency and resulting in the identification of frames most critical for addressing the question. Lastly, we employ an end-to-end Video-Language Pre-training model to provide the answer. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct experiments on the publicly available ATBS dataset[18]. The results showcase the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art models.",No
iccvw_2023_37,FIVA: Facial Image and Video Anonymization and Anonymization Defense.,"In this paper, we present a new approach for facial anonymization in images and videos, abbreviated as FIVA. Our proposed method is able to maintain the same face anonymization consistently over frames with our suggested identity-tracking and guarantees a strong difference from the original face. FIVA allows for 0 true positives for a false acceptance rate of 0.001. Our work considers the important security issue of reconstruction attacks and investigates adversarial noise, uniform noise, and parameter noise to disrupt reconstruction attacks. In this regard, we apply different defense and protection methods against these privacy threats to demonstrate the scalability of FIVA. On top of this, we also show that reconstruction attack models can be used for detection of deep fakes. Last but not least, we provide experimental results showing how FIVA can even enable face swapping, which is purely trained on a single target image.",Yes
iccvw_2023_38,"A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Deepfake Generators: Dataset, Metrics Performance, and Comparative Analysis.","Assessing the realism and accuracy of deepfake generators, especially in cross-reenactment situations, is a major challenge. This challenge is primarily attributed to the absence of ground-truth data, which restricts the application of metrics that rely on explicit ground-truth, such as SSIM and LPIPS. To overcome this challenge, this paper introduces a novel protocol for quantitatively assessing images generated by face-reenactment techniques. To address the scarcity of suitable datasets, two video datasets are generated: the Real Head and the synthesized Metahuman datasets. Furthermore, user studies are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of our proposed protocol. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between subjective evaluations and quantitative metrics obtained within our protocol. Comparative analysis with existing evaluation protocols further validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Notably, our protocol exhibits superior performance in analyzing identity preservation, head pose, and facial expression replication.

iccvw_2023_39,Online Detection of AI-Generated Images.,"With advancements in AI-generated images coming on a continuous basis, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish traditionally-sourced images (e.g., photos, artwork) from AI-generated ones. Previous detection methods study the generalization from a single generator to another in isolation. However, in reality, new generators are released on a streaming basis. We study generalization in this setting, training on N models and testing on the next (N + k), following the historical release dates of well-known generation methods. Furthermore, images increasingly consist of both real and generated components, for example through image inpainting. Thus, we extend this approach to pixel prediction, demonstrating strong performance using automatically-generated inpainted data. In addition, for settings where commercial models are not publicly available for automatic data generation, we evaluate if pixel detectors can be trained solely on whole synthetic images.",No
iccvw_2023_40,WaterLo: Protect Images from Deepfakes Using Localized Semi-Fragile Watermark.,"Most existing contributions in the field of Deepfake detection focus on passive detection methods, where the detector only analyzes the doctored image. However, this approach often lacks the ability to generalize to unseen data and struggles to detect Deepfakes generated using new deepfake models. To address this limitation, our paper proposes an active detection approach, where we have access to the image before the Deepfake is generated. Our solution involves applying a watermark that disappears in modified regions, allowing our detector to identify image modifications and localize them accurately. Additionally, we incorporate a compression module into our training pipeline to enhance the watermarkâ€™s robustness against JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution, achieving a remarkable detection accuracy of 97.83% while maintaining significantly higher image quality compared to previous works. Furthermore, by incorporating the compression module in the training pipeline, we improve the detection accuracy on compressed samples, albeit with a slight decrease in accuracy for non-compressed samples. This contribution also provides a valuable tool for video owners to verify if their videos have been tampered with and safeguard them against unauthorized use.

iccvw_2023_41,TrainFors: A Large Benchmark Training Dataset for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization.,"The evaluation datasets and metrics for image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) research have been standardized. But the training dataset for such a task is still nonstandard. Previous researchers have used unconventional and deviating datasets to train neural networks for detecting image forgeries and localizing pixel maps of manipulated regions. For a fair comparison, the training set, test set, and evaluation metrics should be persistent. Hence, comparing the existing methods may not seem fair as the results depend heavily on the training datasets as well as the model architecture. Moreover, none of the previous works release the synthetic training dataset used for the IMDL task. We propose a standardized benchmark training dataset for image splicing, copy-move forgery, removal forgery, and image enhancement forgery. Furthermore, we identify the problems with the existing IMDL datasets and propose the required modifications. We also train the state-of-the-art IMDL methods on our proposed TrainFors1 dataset for a fair evaluation and report the actual performance of these methods under similar conditions.",No
iccvw_2023_42,Undercover Deepfakes: Detecting Fake Segments in Videos.,"The recent renaissance in generative models, driven primarily by the advent of diffusion models and iterative improvement in GAN methods, has enabled many creative applications. However, each advancement is also accompanied by a rise in the potential for misuse. In the arena of the deepfake generation, this is a key societal issue. In particular, the ability to modify segments of videos using such generative techniques creates a new paradigm of deepfakes which are mostly real videos altered slightly to distort the truth. This paradigm has been under-explored by the current deepfake detection methods in the academic literature. In this paper, we present a deepfake detection method that can address this issue by performing deepfake prediction at the frame and video levels. To facilitate testing our method, we prepared a new benchmark dataset where videos have both real and fake frame sequences with very subtle transitions. We provide a benchmark on the proposed dataset with our detection method which utilizes the Vision Transformer based on Scaling and Shifting [38] to learn spatial features, and a Timeseries Transformer to learn temporal features of the videos to help facilitate the interpretation of possible deepfakes. Extensive experiments on a variety of deepfake generation methods show excellent results by the proposed method on temporal segmentation and classical video-level predictions as well. In particular, the paradigm we address will form a powerful tool for the moderation of deepfakes, where human oversight can be better targeted to the parts of videos suspected of being deepfakes.

iccvw_2023_43,Revisiting Generalizability in Deepfake Detection: Improving Metrics and Stabilizing Transfer.,"""Generalizability"" is seen as the hallmark quality of a good deepfake detection model. However, standard out-of-domain evaluation datasets are very similar in form to the training data and lag behind the advancements in modern synthesis methods, making them highly insufficient metrics for robustness. We extend the study of transfer performance of three state-of-the-art methods (that use spatial, temporal, and lip-reading features respectively) on four newer fake types released within the last year. Depending on the artifact modes they were trained on, detection methods fail in different scenarios. On diffusion fakes, the aforementioned methods get 96%, 75%, and 51% AUC respectively, whereas on talking-head fakes, the same methods get 80%, 99%, and 92% AUC. We compare various methods of combining spatial and temporal modalities through joint training and feature fusion in order to stabilize generalization performance.We also propose a new, randomized algorithm to synthesize videos that emulate diverse, visually apparent artifacts with implausibilities in human facial-structure. By testing deepfake detectors on highly randomized artifacts, we can measure the level to which detection networks have learned a strong model for ""reality"", as opposed to memorizing subtle artifact patterns.",No
iccvw_2023_44,Learning Interpretable Forensic Representations via Local Window Modulation.,"The majority of existing image forgeries involve augmenting a specific region of the source image which leaves detectable artifacts and forensic traces. These distinguishing features are mostly found in and around the local neighborhood of the manipulated pixels. However, patch-based detection approaches quickly become intractable due to inefficient computation and low robustness. In this work, we investigate how to effectively learn these forensic representations using local window-based attention techniques. We propose Forensic Modulation Network (ForMoNet) that uses focal modulation and gated attention layers to automatically identify the long and short-range context for any query pixel. Furthermore, the network is more interpretable and computationally efficient than standard self-attention, which is critical for real-world applications. Our evaluation of various benchmarks shows that ForMoNet outperforms existing transformer-based forensic networks by 6% to 11% on different forgeries.",No
iccvw_2023_45,Detecting Images Generated by Deep Diffusion Models using their Local Intrinsic Dimensionality.,"Diffusion models recently have been successfully applied for the visual synthesis of strikingly realistic appearing images. This raises strong concerns about their potential for malicious purposes. In this paper, we propose using the lightweight multi Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (multiLID), which has been originally developed in context of the detection of adversarial examples, for the automatic detection of synthetic images and the identification of the according generator networks. In contrast to many existing detection approaches, which often only work for GAN-generated images, the proposed method provides close to perfect detection results in many realistic use cases. Extensive experiments on known and newly created datasets demonstrate that the proposed multiLID approach exhibits superiority in diffusion detection and model identification.Since the empirical evaluations of recent publications on the detection of generated images are often mainly focused on the ""LSUN-Bedroom"" dataset, we further establish a comprehensive benchmark for the detection of diffusion-generated images, including samples from several diffusion models with different image sizes.The code for our experiments is provided at https://github.com/deepfake-study/deepfake-multiLID.",Yes.
iccvw_2023_46,Deepfakes Signatures Detection in the Handcrafted Features Space.,"In the Handwritten Signature Verification (HSV) literature, several synthetic databases have been developed for data-augmentation purposes, where new specimens and new identities were generated using bio-inspired algorithms, neuromotor synthesizers, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as well as several deep learning methods. These synthetic databases contain synthetic genuine and forgeries specimens which are used to train and build signature verification systems. Researches on generative data assume that synthetic data are as close as possible to real data, this is why, they are either used for training systems when used for data augmentation tasks or are used to fake systems as synthetic attacks. It is worth, however, to point out the existence of a relationship between the handwritten signature authenticity and human behavior and brain. Indeed, a genuine signature is characterised by specific features that are related to the ownerâ€™s personality. The fact which makes signature verification and authentication achievable. Handcrafted features had demonstrated a high capacity to capture personal traits for authenticating real static signatures. We, therefore, Propose in this paper, a handcrafted feature based Writer-Independent (WI) signature verification system to detect synthetic writers and signatures through handcrafted features. We also aim to assess how realistic are synthetic signatures as well as their impact on HSV systemâ€™s performances. Obtained results using 4000 synthetic writers of GPDS synthetic database show that the proposed handcrafted features have considerable ability to detect synthetic signatures vs. two widely used real individuals signatures databases, namely CEDAR and GPDS-300, which reach 98.67% and 94.05% of successful synthetic detection rates respectively.",Yes
iccvw_2023_47,Interpretable-through-prototypes deepfake detection for diffusion models.,"The process of recognizing and distinguishing between real content and content generated by deep learning algorithms, often referred to as deepfakes, is known as deepfake detection. In order to counter the rising threat of deepfakes and maintain the integrity of digital media, research is now being done to create more reliable and precise detection techniques. Deep learning models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been able to generate more detailed and less blurry images in recent years. In this paper, we develop a deepfake detection technique to distinguish original and fake images generated by various Diffusion Models. The developed methodology for deepfake detection takes advantage of features from fine-tuned Vision Transformers (ViTs), combined with existing classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). We demonstrate the proposed methodologyâ€™s ability of interpretability-through-prototypes by analysing support vectors of the SVMs. Additionally, due to the novelty of the topic, there is a lack of open datasets for deepfake detection.

In this paper we discuss a highly practical and effective working pipeline to weed map a wheat field combining GIS and deep learning technology. This pipeline is an end-to-end process including using an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect ultra-high definition whole-field images, labelling and training deep learning models and an efficient evaluation process for the resulting weed map. We show that our method can generate accurate pixel-wise weed maps by only training on small regions of the field, and can generalize well when making predictions back on the larger whole-field orthomosaic image.",No

Therefore, it is crucial to anticipate their quality and harvest them at the best time, which is vital not only for finding the appropriate market but also for minimizing food and economic waste. To this end, non-destructive strawberry quality measurements are useful. Much research is conducted on post-harvest strawberries: the fruits were only analyzed after harvesting and thus, these methods cannot be used to find a good time to harvest. Our research targets pre-harvest analysis for supporting the timing decisions of harvests. As such, we used an infield image dataset that was collected during the cultivation of strawberries. The images are labeled by quality assessments and measurements from post-harvest destructive tests. We evaluated deep learning for quality estimation and trained our algorithms to predict the ripeness, firmness, and sweetness of strawberries. Additionally, we applied depth estimation algorithms and shape inpainting models to estimate the size of strawberries using images. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of infield quality attribute prediction.",No
iccvw_2023_53,Estimation of Crop Production by Fusing Images and Crop Features.,"The increasing global population and the growing frequency of droughts shows the necessity to enhance global food production and meet future food demands. However, achieving long-term food security and effectively mitigating the impact of climate change require a critical emphasis on sustainable systems to increase food production. Hence, automatic estimation of crop production can enable breeders and farmers to make data-driven decisions to optimise resources and maximise efficiency and sustainability. In this work, we have tackled this estimation task by applying deep learning methods to images taken from a digital RGB camera. Moreover, we have improved the results of those models by feeding the models with not only images but also crop features, such as the amount of fertilisers or the amount of water. The proposed data fusion approach can be applied to convolutional- and transformer-based models obtaining good results in both cases.

iccvw_2023_54,Plant Root Occlusion Inpainting with Generative Adversarial Network.,"Three-dimensional (3D) image analysis represents the state-of-the art for phenotyping in the fields of biology and plant science including studies of root system architecture. A widely used approach for capturing root architecture in 3D involves growth of roots in hydroponic media and capture of optical camera views via a stepper-motor-based rotation system. However, the introduction of structures to support 3D root growth system leads to significant occlusion of the roots during image acquisition, thereby causing the complexity and introducing inaccuracy of subsequent operations such as 3D modeling and root traits calculation. Instead of using a traditional manual sketching methods, this project proposes an automatic root gaps detection and inpainting method based on a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The model was trained and evaluated using two distinct maize datasets, both of which were enriched with manually annotated segmentation and inpainting labels. The quantitative analysis of the inpainting results demonstrated variation in the performance of the GAN model. However, promising outcomes were observed with certain instances achieving Intersection of Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) values surpassing 0.9 with specific images or patches exhibiting lower accuracy and reproducibly. Despite this variability, the overall model performance maintained an average range of 0.8-0.9. Our GAN model presents a robust, effective and automatic solution for inpainting plant root gaps, leading to improved accuracy within the phenotyping pipeline. Moreover, the model demonstrates a great generality for inpainting other root system of species or cultivars beyond those encountered during training. The performance of the model exhibits superiority when confronted with less intricate root structures, but it produces less accurate results when confronted with complex root systems with large gaps or high root density.",No
iccvw_2023_55,A new large dataset and a transfer learning methodology for plant phenotyping in Vertical Farms.,"Vertical farming has emerged as a solution to enhance crop cultivation efficiency and overcome limitations in conventional farming methods. Yet, abiotic stresses significantly impact crop quality and increase the risk of food loss. The integration of advanced automation, sensor technology, and deep learning models offers a promising solution for quality monitoring addressing the limitations of stress-specific approaches. Due to the large range of possible quality issues, there is a need for a general method. This study proposes a new plant canopy dataset, dubbed AGM of 1M images, annotated with 18 classes, an in-depth analysis of its quality for its use in transfer learning, and a methodology for detecting canopy stresses in vertical farming. The present study trains ViTbase8, ViTsmall8, and ResNet50 both on ImageNet and the proposed dataset on crop classification. Features from AGM and ImageNet are used for a downstream task on healthy and stress detection using a small annotated validation dataset obtaining 0.97%, 0.93%, and 0.92% best accuracy with the AGM features.

X-ray radiography has emerged as a non-destructive method for quickly detecting internal quality problems. This method provides X-ray imaging data that should be processed in an accurate and efficient way. In this paper, we investigate the classification of healthy and defect apples from different orchards and storage conditions using deep learning. The aim of the study was to select a robust and efficient deep learning network that can be used on an X-ray sorting system in a practical setting in the agrifood industry. To this end, the models were evaluated not only in terms of performance but also computational cost. As biological variability is inherent to agrifood problems, we strongly focused on generalizability of the models by using multiple test sets with apples from another orchard and stored under different conditions. The best model had the GoogLeNet architecture, reaching an accuracy of respectively 100 (0)% on a first test set with apples from another orchard, and 82 (8)% on a second test set stored at other conditions.

Individual plant seed properties influence early development of plants and are thus of interest in plant phenotyping experiments. Seed shape can be measured reliably from images using volume carving, as done in robotic setups such as phenoSeeder. However, about 36 images are needed to obtain a suitably accurate 3d model [33], where image acquisition takes â‰ˆ 20s. For large-scale experiments with thousands of seeds higher throughput is required limiting image acquisition time. We present a deep-learning model that reconstructs an approximate 3d point cloud from fewer images, even only a single view. It has a significantly lower error than linear regression, which has been actively used so far in similar tasks. Using three images reduces imaging time by a factor of 10Ã—, where relative errors of volume length, width, and height are all around 2%. Inference time from the neural network is negligibly short compared with imaging time which enables this method for real-time measurements and sorting.",No
iccvw_2023_58,Analyzing the Behavior of Cauliflower Harvest-Readiness Models by Investigating Feature Relevances.,"The performance of a machine learning model is characterized by its ability to accurately represent the input-output relationship and its behavior on unseen data. A prerequisite for high performance is that causal relationships of features with the model outcome are correctly represented. This work analyses the causal relationships by investigating the relevance of features in machine learning models using conditional independence tests. For this, an attribution method based on Pearlâ€™s causality framework is employed. Our presented approach analyzes two data-driven models designed for the harvest-readiness prediction of cauliflower plants: one base model and one model where the decision process is adjusted based on local explanations. Additionally, we propose a visualization technique inspired by Partial Dependence Plots to gain further insights into the model behavior. The experiments presented in this paper find that both models learn task-relevant features during fine-tuning when compared to the ImageNet pre-trained weights. However, both models differ in their feature relevance, specifically in whether they utilize the image recording date. The experiments further show that our approach is able to reveal that the adjusted model is able to reduce the trends for the observed biases. Furthermore, the adjusted model maintains the desired behavior for the semantically meaningful feature of cauliflower head diameter, predicting higher harvest-readiness scores for higher feature realizations, which is consistent with existing domain knowledge. The proposed investigation approach can be applied to other domain-specific tasks to aid practitioners in evaluating model choices.",No
iccvw_2023_59,Semantic Segmentation of Crops and Weeds with Probabilistic Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification.,"We propose a Bayesian approach for semantic segmentation of crops and weeds. Farmers often manage weeds by applying herbicides to the entire field, which has negative environmental and financial impacts. Site-specific weed management (SSWM) considers the variability in the field and localizes the treatment. The prerequisite for automated SSWM is accurate detection of weeds. Moreover, to integrate a method into a real-world setting, the model should be able to make informed decisions to avoid potential mistakes and consequent losses. Existing methods are deterministic and they cannot go beyond assigning a class label to the unseen input based on the data they were trained with. The main idea of our approach is to quantify prediction uncertainty, while making class predictions. Our method achieves competitive performance in an established dataset for weed segmentation. Moreover, through accurate uncertainty quantification, our method is able to detect cases and areas which it is the most uncertain about. This information is beneficial, if not necessary, while making decisions with real-world implications to avoid unwanted consequences. In this work, we show that an end-to-end trainable Bayesian segmentation network can be successfully deployed for the weed segmentation task. In the future it could be integrated into real weeding systems to contribute to better informed decisions and more reliable automated systems.",No
iccvw_2023_60,Class-Incremental Learning of Plant and Disease Detection: Growing Branches with Knowledge Distillation.,"This paper investigates the problem of class-incremental object detection for agricultural applications where a model needs to learn new plant species and diseases incrementally without forgetting the previously learned ones. We adapt two public datasets to include new categories over time, simulating a more realistic and dynamic scenario. We then compare three class-incremental learning methods that leverage different forms of knowledge distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments show that all three methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, but the Dynamic Y-KD approach, which additionally uses a dynamic architecture that grows new branches to learn new tasks, outperforms ILOD and Faster-ILOD in most settings both on new and old classes.These results highlight the challenges and opportunities of continual object detection for agricultural applications. In particular, we hypothesize that the large intra-class and small inter-class variability that is typical of plant images exacerbate the difficulty of learning new categories without interfering with previous knowledge. We publicly release our code to encourage future work. 1",No
iccvw_2023_61,Adapting Vision Foundation Models for Plant Phenotyping.,"Foundation models are large models pre-trained on tremendous amount of data. They can be typically adapted to diverse downstream tasks with minimal effort. However, as foundation models are usually pre-trained on images or texts sourced from the Internet, their performance in specialized domains, such as plant phenotyping, comes into question. In addition, fully fine-tuning foundation models is time-consuming and requires high computational power. This paper investigates the efficient adaptation of foundation models for plant phenotyping settings and tasks. We perform extensive experiments on fine-tuning three foundation models, MAE, DINO, and DINOv2 on three essential plant phenotyping tasks: leaf counting, instance segmentation, and disease classification. In particular, the pretrained backbones are kept frozen, while two distinct fine-tuning methods are evaluated, namely adapter tuning (using LoRA) and decoder tuning. The experimental results show that a foundation model can be efficiently adapted to multiple plant phenotyping tasks, yielding similar performance as the state-of-the-art (SoTA) models specifically designed or trained for each task. Despite exhibiting great transferability over different tasks, the fine-tuned foundation models perform slightly worse than the SoTA task-specific models in some scenarios, which requires further investigation.",No
iccvw_2023_62,Group-Conditional Conformal Prediction via Quantile Regression Calibration for Crop and Weed Classification.,"As deep learning predictive models become an integral part of a large spectrum of precision agricultural systems, a barrier to the adoption of such automated solutions is the lack of user trust in these highly complex, opaque and uncertain models. Indeed, deep neural networks are not equipped with any explicit guarantees that can be used to certify the systemâ€™s performance, especially in highly varying uncontrolled environments such as the ones typically faced in computer vision for agriculture.Fortunately, certain methods developed in other communities can prove to be important for agricultural applications. This article presents the conformal prediction framework that provides valid statistical guarantees on the predictive performance of any black box prediction machine, with almost no assumptions, applied to the problem of deep visual classification of weeds and crops in real-world conditions. The framework is exposed with a focus on its practical aspects and special attention accorded to the Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) approach that delivers marginal guarantees on the modelâ€™s coverage. Marginal results are then shown to be insufficient to guarantee performance on all groups of individuals in the population as characterized by their environmental and pedo-climatic auxiliary data gathered during image acquisition.To tackle this shortcoming, group-conditional conformal approaches are presented: the ""classical"" method that consists of iteratively applying the APS procedure on all groups, and a proposed elegant reformulation and implementation of the procedure using quantile regression on group membership indicators. Empirical results showing the validity of the proposed approach are presented and compared to the marginal APS then discussed.",No
iccvw_2023_63,Vision-based Monitoring of the Short-term Dynamic Behaviour of Plants for Automated Phenotyping.,"Modern computer vision technology plays an increasingly important role in agriculture. Automated monitoring of plants for example is an essential task in several applications, such as high-throughput phenotyping or plant health monitoring. Under external influences like wind, plants typically exhibit dynamic behaviours which reveal important characteristics of their structure and condition. These behaviours, however, are typically not considered by state-of-the-art automated phenotyping methods which mostly observe static plant properties. In this paper, we propose an automated system for monitoring oscillatory plant movement from video sequences. We employ harmonic inversion for the purpose of efficiently and accurately estimating the eigenfrequency and damping parameters of individual plant parts. The achieved accuracy is compared against values obtained by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which we use as a baseline. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on different plants and plant parts, like wheat ears, hanging vines, as well as stems and stalks, which exhibit a range of oscillatory motions. By utilising harmonic inversion, we are able to consistently obtain more accurate values for the eigenfrequencies compared to those obtained by DFT. We are furthermore able to directly estimate values for the damping coefficient, achieving a similar accuracy as via DFT-based methods, but without the additional computational effort required for the latter. With the approach presented in this paper, it is possible to obtain estimates of mechanical plant characteristics in an automated manner, enabling novel automated acquisition of novel traits for phenotyping.",No
iccvw_2023_64,Rapid tomato DUS trait analysis using an optimized mobile-based coarse-to-fine instance segmentation algorithm.,"As climate change continues to impact agriculture, there is a growing demand for the discovery of new crop varieties in order to address key goals such as accelerated production, disease resistance, and overall improved quality. One of the necessary procedures before a crop variety is accepted for production is distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) testing. However, the current practice of DUS testing relies primarily on manual examination with limited technological assistance. This work aims to provide a solution to this challenge by developing an algorithm for rapid tomato DUS trait analysis using a mobile application. An image dataset comprised of tray and individual tomato images was compiled using multiple mobile devices. A coarse-to-fine instance segmentation algorithm was developed to analyze the tray images by detecting individual tomato images and detecting tomato and peduncle scar contours. In order to accommodate different mobile devices and achieve finer measurements, a conditional upscaling approach was applied on each individual tomato image, with the support of super-resolution. Android ARCore was utilized to obtain distances of each tomato from the mobile device camera, enabling fast morphological measurements without using reference scales. The proposed algorithm has a precision of 0.99 in detecting each tomato from each tray image, while having IoUseg values of 0.97 and 0.83 in segmenting tomato and peduncle scars, respectively. Manual vs. automated trait analysis results also show that the mobile application was able to measure traits with an error from 1.66% to 7.19%. From the best of our knowledge, this work presents one of the first mobile phone applications for rapid tomato DUS trait analysis.",No
iccvw_2023_65,Pollinators as Data Collectors: Estimating Floral Diversity with Bees and Computer Vision.,"This paper presents a bee-based environment monitoring system that uses pollen color analysis to estimate floral diversity.

By strategically placing cameras at the beehive entrance, the system captures pollen color samples without disrupting the beesâ€™ natural foraging behavior. The collected pollen color data is analyzed using computer vision techniques, including pollen color classification and diversity assessment. The feasibility of the approach is evaluated through comparisons with laboratory analysis results and an appliance for capturing pollen color under ideal conditions.

iccvw_2023_66,Inductive Conformal Prediction for Harvest-Readiness Classification of Cauliflower Plants: A Comparative Study of Uncertainty Quantification Methods.,"Quantifying the uncertainty of machine learning models is a promising way to make better-informed decisions in digital agriculture. Efforts have been made to address this, ranging from understanding and segregating sources of uncertainty to utilizing diverse approaches for quantifying the cumulative amount. However, in order to fully realize the potential of uncertainty quantification in digital agriculture, more research is needed to compare and contrast different methods and determine which are most effective in different contexts. In this paper, we investigate inductive conformal prediction as another family of machine learning methods besides the commonly used softmax outputs and Monte Carlo dropout. Inductive conformal prediction constructs valid prediction sets by selecting a pre-defined level of predictive confidence in the system. In our experiments, we analyze this method for an image-based harvest-readiness classification task of cauliflower plants, and compare the results to softmax outputs and uncertainties derived from Monte Carlo dropout. Inductive conformal prediction turns out as a complementary tool offering distinct advantages and providing another level of information for decision support.",No
iccvw_2023_67,Detection of Fusarium Damaged Kernels in Wheat Using Deep Semi-Supervised Learning on a Novel WheatSeedBelt Dataset.,"Fusarium head blight, caused by Fusarium spp., is a destructive disease of wheat worldwide. Fusarium damaged kernels (FDKs) significantly reduce grain yield and quality. Thus, FDK detection is a priority for wheat breeders seeking to develop high-grain quality and FDK-resistant wheat cultivars. However, traditional FDK measurement methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and of variable accuracy. Image-based phenotyping methods have the potential to efficiently detect FDK, but are challenging to develop due to the lack of large-scale damage-annotated wheat kernel datasets. Addressing this issue, we introduced WheatSeedBelt, a high-resolution large-scale dataset including 40,420 close-up top- and side-view single-kernel images of 268 wheat varieties with kernel damage annotations. Utilizing this dataset, we developed an image-processing pipeline to efficiently process images and extract the representative features for machine and deep-learning purposes. We also conducted three experiments on the dataset using pretraining and semi-supervised fine-tuning phases to classify wheat kernels into healthy, unhealthy but non-FDK, and FDK affected. Our best models achieved an F1-score of 84.29% for the Healthy-Unhealthy (including FDKs) task, 56.35% for the binary FDK-nonFDK, and 68.30% for the 3-class task (Healthy, Unhealthy, and FDK). We also conducted an inter-rater reliability study, which indicated that human experts do not outperform our model in FDK prediction, providing evidence that visual classification of FDK from RGB images is a challenging task.",No
iccvw_2023_68,Embedded plant recognition: a benchmark for low footprint deep neural networks.,"Plant recognition is a challenging task due to the following elements: many classes, the variability of organs within a species, the similarity of organs between species, the shooting conditions, etc. There exist many mobile applications for plant recognition but most of them require an Internet connection to send the image to a server that will compute the recognition and, send the result back. However, in nature, in the mountains or in the forest, Internet connections are very often poor or non-existent. The only embedded plant recognition application is InterFolia based on SqueezeNet network but is it the best architecture to recognize plants? In this work, we propose to compare main existing networks that can be embedded allowing the recognition of plants from their organs (leaves, flowers/fruits, barks). The aim is to study how these networks behave in the face of this difficult problem to highlight their advantages and disadvantages in this context. The elements of comparison are not only the performance of the networks but also their memory impact and their inference time on computer and smartphone. Such elements could be extended to other applications in similar contexts, such as embedded phenotyping. We also propose a dataset with 477 plant classes that we make available to the scientific community1.",No
iccvw_2023_69,Unlocking Comparative Plant Scoring with Siamese Neural Networks and Pairwise Pseudo Labelling.,"Phenotypic assessment of plants for herbicide discovery is a complex visual task and involves the comparison of a non-treated plant to those treated with herbicides to assign a phytotoxicity score. It is often subjective and difficult to quantify by human observers. Employing novel computer vision approaches using neural networks in order to be non-subjective and truly quantitative offers advantages for data quality, leading to improved decision making.In this paper we present a deep learning approach for comparative plant assessment using Siamese neural networks, an architecture that takes pairs of images as inputs, and we overcome the hurdles of data collection by proposing a novel pseudo-labelling approach for combining different pairs of input images. We demonstrate a high level of accuracy with this method, comparable to human scoring, and present a series of experiments grading Amaranthus retroflexus weeds using our trained model.",No
iccvw_2023_70,Unified Automatic Plant Cover and Phenology Prediction.,"The composition and phenology of plant communities are paramount indicators for environmental changes, especially climate change, and are, due to this, subject to many ecological studies. While species composition and phenology are usually monitored by ecologists directly in the field, this process is slow, laborious, and prone to human error. In contrast, automated camera systems with intelligent image analysis methods can provide fast analyses with a high temporal resolution and therefore are highly advantageous for ecological research. Nowadays, methods already exist that can analyze the plant community composition from images, and others that investigate the phenology of plants. However, there are no automatic approaches that analyze the plant community composition together with the phenology of the same community, which is why we aim to close this gap by combining an existing plant cover prediction method based on convolutional neural networks with a novel phenology prediction module. The module builds on the species- and pixel-wise occurrence probabilities generated during the plant cover prediction process, and by that, significantly improves the quality of phenology predictions compared to isolated training of plant cover and phenology. We evaluate our approach by comparing the time trends of the observed and predicted phenology values on the InsectArmageddon dataset comprising cover and phenology data of eight herbaceous plant species. We find that our method significantly outperforms two dataset-statistics-based prediction baselines as well as a naive baseline that does not integrate any information from the plant cover prediction module.",No
iccvw_2023_71,Reinforcement learning with space carving for plant scanning.,"Optimal plant reconstruction is an essential element in automating our future agriculture. Computerized inspection of proper growth, nutrition, or pest infestation has become mandatory in fully autonomous in-door or micro-farm settings, shifting from fixed to moving camera systems. In industrial environments, plant scanning must work efficiently with a limited number of significant images to become economically viable. We present an adaptive learning algorithm for agricultural plant inspection robots, in particular, a specific type of reinforcement learning that we developed for our micro-farming platform created within the EU project ROMI. We suggest a new approach to 3D plant reconstruction by integrating the space carving technique with categorical Deep Q-Networks. Space carving leverages images captured from various positions to create a binary voxel grid, representing the occupied and unoccupied spaces of the scanned object. The proposed method incorporates partial 3D reconstructions of plants obtained through space carving, which get compared to a ground truth model to calculate the reward and guide scanning policies. We explain the algorithmic details and the 3D reconstruction technique in design, implementation, and evaluation. Experimental results confirm our approachâ€™s effectiveness in improving the 3D plant reconstruction process, highlighting its potential for further applications in agriculture and related fields.",No

The current manual control methods, such as plucking weed, are labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper introduces a workflow towards automated regulation of J. Vulgaris, which consists of the two independent tasks of deep learning-based monitoring and controlling. We aim to detect and control J. Vulgaris in an early growth stage before the plant can reseed, which challenges the data collection and the training of deep neural networks. Primarily we need to detect the green leaf rosettes on a green meadow. The main focus lies on the monitoring part with synthetic training data generation and a deep neural network-based labeling assistant.",No
iccvw_2023_73,Efficient Grapevine Structure Estimation in Vineyards Conditions.,"Developing computer vision systems for agricultural tasks that work in real-world conditions and in real time is challenging, especially if they need to be deployed on embedded devices, such as tablets or augmented reality glasses.

Specifically, we propose a lightweight network for detecting nodes and branches in images which are then used to recover the tree structure.Our approach is validated on the publicly available 3D2Cut dataset. Compared to the ViNet method [11], we demonstrate computational performance while preserving the high accuracy of its predictions. Furthermore, we created a new dataset to train our workflow in real vineyard conditions without an artificial background. We demonstrate that we can obtain remarkable results in real and challenging conditions while being efficient.",No
iccvw_2023_74,A Hybrid Visual Transformer for Efficient Deep Human Activity Recognition.,"Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide-ranging applications. This paper introduces a novel hybrid visual transformer methodology designed to enhance the robust analysis and comprehension of activities. CVTN (Convolution Visual Transformer Network) leverages sensor data represented jointly in spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance the resilience of the HAR process. The proposed technique employs a hybrid model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Visual Transformers (VTs). Initially, the CNN component learns spatial visual features from diverse sensor data. Subsequently, these acquired visual features are inputted into the transformer segment of the model. VT captures temporal insights by observing sensor statuses across different time points. The efficacy of the CVTN methodology is assessed using the Kinetics dataset, which emulates real-world human activity recognition scenarios. The experimental results reveal clear superiority compared to the recent baseline HAR solutions, reaffirming its potential for advancing activity analysis.",No
iccvw_2023_75,SCSC: Spatial Cross-scale Convolution Module to Strengthen both CNNs and Transformers.,"This paper presents a module, Spatial Cross-scale Convolution (SCSC), which is verified to be effective in improving both CNNs and Transformers. Nowadays, CNNs and Transformers have been successful in a variety of tasks. Especially for Transformers, increasing works achieve state-of-the-art performance in the computer vision community. Therefore, researchers start to explore the mechanism of those architectures. Large receptive fields, sparse connections, weight sharing, and dynamic weight have been considered keys to designing effective base models [39], [24], [63], [44]. However, there are still some issues to be addressed: large dense kernels and self-attention are inefficient, and large receptive fields make it hard to capture local features. Inspired by the above analyses and to solve the mentioned problems, in this paper, we design a general module taking in these design keys to enhance both CNNs and Transformers. SCSC introduces an efficient spatial cross-scale encoder and spatial embed module to capture assorted features in one layer. On the face recognition task, FaceResNet with SCSC can improve 2.7% with 68% fewer FLOPs1 and 79% fewer parameters. On the ImageNet classification task, Swin Transformer with SCSC can achieve even better performance with 22% fewer FLOPs, and ResNet with CSCS can improve 5.3% with similar complexity. Furthermore, a traditional network (e.g., ResNet) embedded with SCSC can match Swin Transformerâ€™s performance.",No
iccvw_2023_76,TSOSVNet: Teacher-student collaborative knowledge distillation for Online Signature Verification.,"Online signature verification (OSV) is a standardized personal authentication scheme with wide social acceptance in critical real-time applications include access control, m-commerce, etc. Even though the current advances in Deep learning (DL) technologies catalysed state-of-the-art frameworks for challenging domains like computer vision, speech recognition, etc., the DL-based frameworks are voluminous with huge trainable parameters and are hard to deploy in real-time systems demanding faster inference. To adopt DL into OSV for improved performance, we propose an OSV framework made up of teacher-student collaborative knowledge distillation (TSKD) technique. A heavy Transformer based teacher is trained first and the teacher knowledge is distilled into a very lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based student. A well trained teacher network results in an efficient deep representative feature learning by the student and results in a performance improvement. In a thorough set of experiments with three popular and standard datasets, i.e., the MCYT-100, SUSIG, and SVC, TSOSVNet framework, with a CNN based student model requiring only 3266 trainable parameters results in an EER of 12.42% compared to the recent SOTA 13.38% by a model with 206277 parameters in skilled_01 category of MCYT-100 dataset. In comparison to cutting-edge CNN-based OSV models, the proposed TSOSVNet produced a state-of-the-art EER in the most of the test categories with an average of 90% lesser trainable parameters.",No
iccvw_2023_77,SeMask: Semantically Masked Transformers for Semantic Segmentation.,"Finetuning a pretrained backbone in the encoder part of an image transformer network has been the traditional approach for the semantic segmentation task. However, such an approach leaves out the semantic context that an image provides during the encoding stage. This paper argues that incorporating semantic information of the image into pretrained hierarchical transformer-based backbones while finetuning improves the performance considerably. To achieve this, we propose SeMask, a simple and effective framework that incorporates semantic information into the encoder with the help of a semantic attention operation. In addition, we use a lightweight semantic decoder during training to provide supervision to the intermediate semantic prior maps at every stage. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating semantic priors enhances the performance of the established hierarchical encoders with a slight increase in the number of FLOPs. We provide empirical proof by integrating SeMask into Swin Transformer and Mix Transformer backbones as our encoder paired with different decoders. Our framework achieves impressive performance of 58.25% mIoU on the ADE20K dataset with SeMask Swin-L backbone and improvements of over 3% in the mIoU metric on the Cityscapes dataset.

iccvw_2023_78,Interactive Image Segmentation with Cross-Modality Vision Transformers.,"Interactive image segmentation aims to segment the target from the background with the manual guidance, which takes as input multimodal data such as images, clicks, scribbles, polygons, and bounding boxes. Recently, vision transformers have achieved a great success in several downstream visual tasks, and a few efforts have been made to bring this powerful architecture to interactive segmentation task. However, the previous works neglect the relations between two modalities and directly mock the way of processing purely visual information with self-attentions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective network for click-based interactive segmentation with cross-modality vision transformers. Cross-modality transformers exploit mutual information to better guide the learning process. The experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in comparison to the previous state-of-the-art models. In addition, the stability of our method in term of avoiding failure cases shows its potential to be a practical annotation tool. The code and pretrained models will be released under https://github.com/lik1996/iCMFormer.",No
iccvw_2023_79,Which Tokens to Use? Investigating Token Reduction in Vision Transformers.,"Since the introduction of the Vision Transformer (ViT), researchers have sought to make ViTs more efficient by removing redundant information in the processed tokens. While different methods have been explored to achieve this goal, we still lack understanding of the resulting reduction patterns and how those patterns differ across token reduction methods and datasets. To close this gap, we set out to understand the reduction patterns of 10 different token reduction methods using four image classification datasets. By systematically comparing these methods on the different classification tasks, we find that the Top-K pruning method is a surprisingly strong baseline. Through in-depth analysis of the different methods, we determine that: the reduction patterns are generally not consistent when varying the capacity of the backbone model, the reduction patterns of pruning-based methods significantly differ from fixed radial patterns, and the reduction patterns of pruning-based methods are correlated across classification datasets. Finally we report that the similarity of reduction patterns is a moderate-to-strong proxy for model performance. Project page at https://vap.aau.dk/tokens.",No
iccvw_2023_80,Actor-agnostic Multi-label Action Recognition with Multi-modal Query.,"Existing action recognition methods are typically actor-specific due to the intrinsic topological and apparent differences among the actors. This requires actor-specific pose estimation (e.g., humans vs. animals), leading to cumbersome model design complexity and high maintenance costs. Moreover, they often focus on learning the visual modality alone and single-label classification whilst neglecting other available information sources (e.g., class name text) and the concurrent occurrence of multiple actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach called â€˜actor-agnostic multi-modal multi-label action recognition,â€™ which offers a unified solution for various types of actors, including humans and animals. We further formulate a novel Multi-modal Semantic Query Network (MSQNet) model in a transformer-based object detection framework (e.g., DETR), characterized by leveraging visual and textual modalities to represent the action classes better. The elimination of actor-specific model designs is a key advantage, as it removes the need for actor pose estimation altogether. Extensive experiments on five publicly available benchmarks show that our MSQNet consistently outperforms the prior arts of actor-specific alternatives on human and animal single- and multi-label action recognition tasks by up to 50%.

iccvw_2023_81,Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Transformers for Video Object Segmentation.,"This paper presents a novel framework called HST for semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS). HST extracts image and video features using the latest Swin Transformer and Video Swin Transformer to inherit their inductive bias for the spatiotemporal locality, which is essential for temporally coherent VOS. To take full advantage of the image and video features, HST casts image and video features as a query and memory, respectively. By applying efficient memory read operations at multiple scales, HST produces hierarchical features for the precise reconstruction of object masks. HST shows effectiveness and robustness in handling challenging scenarios with occluded and fast-moving objects under cluttered backgrounds. In particular, HST-B outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors on multiple popular benchmarks, i.e., YouTube-VOS (85.0%), DAVIS 2017 (85.9%), and DAVIS 2016 (94.0%).",No
iccvw_2023_82,Explaining through Transformer Input Sampling.,"Vision Transformers are becoming more and more the preferred solution to many computer vision problems, which has motivated the development of dedicated explainability methods. Among them, perturbation-based methods offer an elegant way to build saliency maps by analyzing how perturbations of the input image affect the network prediction. However, those methods suffer from the drawback of introducing outlier image features that might mislead the explainability process, e.g. by affecting the output classes independently of the initial image content. To overcome this issue, this paper introduces Transformer Input Sampling (TIS), a perturbation-based explainability method for Vision Transformers, which computes a saliency map based on perturbations induced by a sampling of the input tokens. TIS utilizes the natural property of Transformers which permits a variable input number of tokens, thereby preventing the use of replacement values to generate perturbations. Using standard models such as ViT and DeiT for benchmarking, TIS demonstrates superior performance on several metrics including Insertion, Deletion, and Pointing Game compared to state-of-the-art explainability methods for Transformers. The code for TIS is publicly available at https://github.com/aenglebert/Transformer_Input_Sampling.",No
iccvw_2023_83,IDTransformer: Transformer for Intrinsic Image Decomposition.,"The aim of intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is to recover reflectance and the shading from a given image. As different combinations are possible, IID is an under constrained problem. Previous approaches try to constrain the search space using hand crafted priors. However, these priors are based on strong imaging assumptions and fall short when these do not hold. Deep learning based methods learn the problem end-to-end from the data. But these networks lack any explicit information about the image formation model.In this paper, an IID transformer approach (IDTransformer) is proposed by learning photometric invariant attention, derived from the image formation model, integrated in the transformer framework. The combination of invariant features in both a global and local setting allows the network to not only learn reflectance transitions, but also to group similar reflectance regions, irrespective of the spatial arrangement. Illumination and geometry invariant attention is exploited to generate the reflectance map, while illumination invariant and geometry variant attention is used to compute the shading map.Enabling physics-based explicit attention allows the network to be trained on a relatively small dataset. Ablation studies show that adding invariant attention improves the performance. Experiments on the Intrinsic In the Wild dataset shows competitive results with competing methods.

iccvw_2023_84,All-pairs Consistency Learning for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation.,"In this work, we propose a new transformer-based regularization to better localize objects for Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). In image-level WSSS, Class Activation Map (CAM) is adopted to generate object localization as pseudo segmentation labels. To address the partial activation issue of the CAMs, consistency regularization is employed to maintain activation intensity invariance across various image augmentations. However, such methods ignore pair-wise relations among regions within each CAM, which capture context and should also be invariant across image views. To this end, we propose a new all-pairs consistency regularization (ACR). Given a pair of augmented views, our approach regularizes the activation intensities between a pair of augmented views, while also ensuring that the affinity across regions within each view remains consistent. We adopt vision transformers as the self-attention mechanism naturally embeds pair-wise affinity. This enables us to simply regularize the distance between the attention matrices of augmented image pairs. Additionally, we introduce a novel class-wise localization method that leverages the gradients of the class token. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing WSSS methods using transformers without modifying the architectures. We evaluate our method on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Our method produces noticeably better class localization maps (67.3% mIoU on PASCAL VOC train), resulting in superior WSSS performances.",No
iccvw_2023_85,MSViT: Dynamic Mixed-scale Tokenization for Vision Transformers.,"The input tokens to Vision Transformers carry little semantic meaning as they are defined as regular equal-sized patches of the input image, regardless of its content. However, processing uniform background areas of an image should not necessitate as much compute as dense, cluttered areas. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic mixed-scale tokenization scheme for ViT, MSViT. Our method introduces a conditional gating mechanism that selects the optimal token scale for every image region, such that the number of tokens is dynamically determined per input. In addition, to enhance the conditional behavior of the gate during training, we introduce a novel generalization of the batch-shaping loss. We show that our gating module is able to learn meaningful semantics despite operating locally at the coarse patch-level. The proposed gating module is lightweight, agnostic to the choice of transformer backbone, and trained within a few epochs with little training overhead. Furthermore, in contrast to token pruning, MSViT does not lose information about the input, thus can be readily applied for dense tasks. We validate MSViT on the tasks of classification and segmentation where it leads to improved accuracy-complexity trade-off.",No
iccvw_2023_86,TransInpaint: Transformer-based Image Inpainting with Context Adaptation.,"Image inpainting aims to generate realistic content for missing regions of an image. Existing methods often struggle to produce visually coherent content for missing regions of an image, which results in blurry or distorted structures around the damaged areas. These methods rely on surrounding texture information and have difficulty in generating content that harmonizes well with the broader context of the image. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model that generates plausible content for missing regions while ensuring that the generated content is consistent with the overall context of the original image. In particular, we introduce a novel context-adaptive transformer for image inpainting (TransInpaint) that relies on the visible content and the position of the missing regions. Additionally, we design a texture enhancement network that combines skip features from the encoder with the coarse features produced by the generator, yielding a more comprehensive and robust representation of image content. Based on extensive evaluations on challenging datasets, our proposed TransInpaint outperforms the cutting-edge generative models for image inpainting in terms of quality, textures, and structures.",No
iccvw_2023_87,Spatio-Temporal Convolution-Attention Video Network.,"In this paper, we present a hierarchical neural network based on convolutional and attention modeling for short and long-range video reasoning, called Spatio-Temporal Convolution-Attention Video Network (STCA). The proposed method is capable of learning appearance and temporal cues in two stages with different temporal depths to maximize engagement of the short-range and long-range video sequences. It has the benefits of convolutional and attention networks in exploiting spatial and temporal cues for a new spatio-temporal sequence modeling. Our method is a novel mixer architecture to obtain robust properties of convolution (such as translational equivariance) while having the generalization and sequential modeling ability of transformers to deal with dynamic variations in videos. The proposed video deep neural network aims to exploit spatio-temporal information in two stages: 1.) Short Clip Stage (SCS) and 2.) Long Video Stage (LVS). SCS handles spatio-temporal cues dealing with short-range video clips and operates on video frames with 3D convolutions and multi-headed self-attention modeling. Since SCS operates on video frames, this reduces the quadratic complexity of the self-attention operation. In LVS, we mitigate the issue of modeling long-range temporal self-attention. LVS models long-range temporal reasoning using representation (i.e., tokens) obtained from SCS. LVS consists of variants of long-range temporal modeling mechanisms for learning compact and robust global temporal representations of the entire video. We conduct experiments on six challenging video recognition datasets: HVU, Kinetics (400, 600, 700), Something-Something V2, and Long Video Understanding dataset.

However, challenges persist due to the limited availability of labelled medical imaging data and the substantial cost of data annotation. This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised learning strategy, amalgamating pseudo-labelling and contrastive learning with a consistency regularization framework. This innovative approach incorporates a modified contrastive learning strategy and a confidence-aware pseudo-labeling strategy, both of which are integrated into a dual-segmentation network ensemble learning structure. Inspired by the recent success of self-attention mechanisms, we harness the power of the Vision Transofmer(ViT) within our proposed semi-supervised framework, and conduct a comprehensive comparison among various combinations of ViT and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with the proposed strategy. The efficacy of our proposed method is validated using a publicly available medical image segmentation dataset, where it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance against established methods.

As reconstructing motion from monocular video is ill-posed, we systematically analyze different 2D and 3D motion representations for this problem and their importance for segmentation performance. Finally, we analyze the effect of training data and show that diverse datasets are required to achieve SotA performance on Kitti and Davis. Code will be released upon publication.",No
iccvw_2023_90,MOSAIC: Multi-Object Segmented Arbitrary Stylization Using CLIP.,"Style transfer driven by text prompts paved a new path for creatively stylizing the images without collecting an actual style image. Despite having promising results, with text-driven stylization, the user has no control over the stylization. If a user wants to create an artistic image, the user requires fine control over the stylization of various entities individually in the content image, which is not addressed by the current state-of-the-art approaches. On the other hand, diffusion style transfer methods also suffer from the same issue because the regional stylization control over the stylized output is ineffective. To address this problem, We propose a new method Multi-Object Segmented Arbitrary Stylization Using CLIP (MOSAIC), that can apply styles to different objects in the image based on the context extracted from the input prompt. Text-based segmentation and stylization modules which are based on vision transformer architecture, were used to segment and stylize the objects. Our method can extend to any arbitrary objects, styles and produce high-quality images compared to the current state of art methods. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to perform text-guided arbitrary object-wise stylization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing that it can generate visually appealing stylized images with enhanced control over stylization and the ability to generalize to unseen object classes.",No

Due to the presence of diverse lighting conditions and geometric distortions in real-world photographs of documents, document image restoration typically consists of two stages: first, geometric unwarping to remove the displacement distortions and, second illumination correction to reinstate the original colors. In this work, we tackle the problem of illumination correction for document images and, thereby, enhance downstream tasks, such as text extraction and document archival. Despite the recent state-of-the-art improvements in geometric unwarping, the reliability of those models is limited. Hence, we aim to reduce lighting impurity under the assumption of imperfectly unwarped documents. To reduce the complexity of the task, we incorporate a-priori known visual cues in the form of template images, which offer additional information about the perfect lighting conditions. In this work, we present a novel approach for integrating prior visual cues in the form of document templates. Our extensive evaluation shows a 15.0 % relative improvement in LPIPS and 6.3 % in CER over the state-of-the-art. We made all code and data publicly available at https://felixhertlein.github.io/illtrtemplate.",No
iccvw_2023_92,Adaptive Self-Training for Object Detection.,"Deep learning has emerged as an effective solution for solving the task of object detection in images but at the cost of requiring large labeled datasets. To mitigate this cost, semi-supervised object detection methods, which consist in leveraging abundant unlabeled data, have been proposed and have already shown impressive results. These methods however often rely on a thresholding mechanism to allocate pseudo-labels. This threshold value is usually determined empirically for a dataset, which is time consuming and requires a new and costly parameter search when the domain changes. In this work, we introduce a new teacher-student method, named Adaptive Self-Training for Object Detection (ASTOD), which is simple and effective. ASTOD selects pseudo-labels adaptively by examining the score histogram. In addition, we also introduce the idea to systematically refine the student, after training, with the labeled data only to improve its performance. While the teacher and the student of ASTOD are trained separately, in the end, the refined student replaces the teacher in an iterative fashion.Our experiments show that, on the MS-COCO dataset, our method consistently outperforms other adaptive state-of-the-art methods, and performs equally with respect to methods that require a manual parameter sweep search, and are therefore of limited use in practice. Additional experiments with respect to a supervised baseline on the DIOR dataset containing satellite images lead to similar conclusions, and prove that it is possible to adapt the score threshold automatically in self-training, regardless of the data distribution. The code is available at https://github.com/rvandeghen/ASTOD.",No
iccvw_2023_93,Tensor Factorization for Leveraging Cross-Modal Knowledge in Data-Constrained Infrared Object Detection.,"While state-of-the-art object detection methods have reached some level of maturity for regular RGB images, there is still some distance to be covered before these methods perform comparably on Infrared (IR) images. The primary bottleneck towards accomplishing this goal is the lack of sufficient labeled training data in the IR modality, owing to the cost of acquiring such data. Realizing that object detection methods for the RGB modality are quite robust (at least for some commonplace classes, like person, car, etc.), thanks to the giant training sets that exist, in this work we seek to leverage cues from the RGB modality to scale object detectors to the IR modality, while preserving model performance in the RGB modality. At the core of our method, is a novel tensor decomposition method called TensorFact which splits the convolution kernels of a layer of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) into low-rank factor matrices, with fewer parameters than the original CNN. We first pre-train these factor matrices on the RGB modality, for which plenty of training data are assumed to exist and then augment only a few trainable parameters for training on the IR modality â€“ to avoid over-fitting, while encouraging them to capture complementary cues from those trained only on the RGB modality. We validate our approach empirically by first assessing how well our TensorFact decomposed network performs at the task of detecting objects in RGB images vis-Ã¡-vis the original network and then look at how well it adapts to IR images of the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset. For the latter, we train models under scenarios that pose challenges stemming from data paucity. From the experiments, we observe that: (i) TensorFact shows performance gains on RGB images; (ii) further, this pre-trained model, when fine-tuned, outperforms a standard state-of-the-art object detector on the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset by about 4% in terms of mAP 50 score.",No
iccvw_2023_94,Learning Universal Semantic Correspondences with No Supervision and Automatic Data Curation.,"We study the problem of learning semantic image correspondences without manual supervision. Previous works that tackled this problem rely on manually curated image pairs and learn benchmark-specific correspondences. Instead, we present a new method that learns universal correspondences once, from a large image dataset, and without using any manual curation. Despite their generality and despite using less supervision, our universal correspondences still outperform prior works, unsupervised and weakly supervised, in most benchmarks. Our approach starts from local features extracted by an unsupervised vision transformer, which obtain good semantic but poor geometric matching accuracy. It then learns a Transformer Adapter which improves the geometric accuracy of the features, as well as their compatibility between pairs of different images. The method combines semantic similarity with geometric stability obtained via cycle consistency and supervision via synthetic transformations. We use these features to also select pairs of matching images for training the unsupervised correspondences.",No
iccvw_2023_95,Semantic RGB-D Image Synthesis.,"Collecting diverse sets of training images for RGB-D semantic image segmentation is not always possible. In particular, when robots need to operate in privacy-sensitive areas like homes, the collection is often limited to a small set of locations. As a consequence, the annotated images lack diversity in appearance and approaches for RGB-D semantic image segmentation tend to overfit the training data. In this paper, we thus introduce semantic RGB-D image synthesis to address this problem. It requires synthesising a realistic-looking RGB-D image for a given semantic label map. Current approaches, however, are unimodal and cannot cope with multi-modal data. Indeed, we show that extending uni-modal approaches to multi-modal data does not perform well. In this paper, we therefore propose a generator for multi-modal data that separates modal-independent information of the semantic layout from the modal-dependent information that is needed to generate an RGB and a depth image, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a discriminator that ensures semantic consistency between the label maps and the generated images and perceptual similarity between the real and generated images. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous uni-modal methods by a large margin and that the accuracy of an approach for RGB-D semantic segmentation can be significantly improved by mixing real and generated images during training.",No
iccvw_2023_96,JEDI: Joint Expert Distillation in a Semi-Supervised Multi-Dataset Student-Teacher Scenario for Video Action Recognition.,"We propose JEDI, a multi-dataset semi-supervised learning method, which efficiently combines knowledge from multiple experts, learned on different datasets, to train and improve the performance of individual, per dataset, student models. Our approach achieves this by addressing two important problems in current machine learning research: generalization across datasets and limitations of supervised training due to scarcity of labeled data. We start with an arbitrary number of experts, pretrained on their own specific dataset, which form the initial set of student models. The teachers are immediately derived by concatenating the feature representations from the penultimate layers of the students. We then train all models in a student-teacher semi-supervised learning scenario until convergence. In our efficient approach, student-teacher training is carried out jointly and end-to-end, showing that both students and teachers improve their generalization capacity during training. We validate our approach on four video action recognition datasets. By simultaneously considering all datasets within a unified semi-supervised setting, we demonstrate significant improvements over the initial experts.",No
iccvw_2023_97,Frequency-Aware Self-Supervised Long-Tailed Learning.,"Data collected from the real world typically exhibit long-tailed distributions, where frequent classes contain abundant data while rare ones have only a limited number of samples. While existing supervised learning approaches have been proposed to tackle such data imbalance, the requirement of label supervision would limit their applicability to real-world scenarios in which label annotation might not be available. Without the access to class labels nor the associated class frequencies, we propose Frequency-Aware Self-Supervised Learning (FASSL) in this paper. Targeting at learning from unlabeled data with inherent long-tailed distributions, the goal of FASSL is to produce discriminative feature representations for downstream classification tasks. In FASSL, we first learn frequency-aware prototypes, reflecting the associated long-tailed distribution. Particularly focusing on rare-class samples, the relationships between image data and the derived prototypes are further exploited with the introduced self-supervised learning scheme. Experiments on long-tailed image datasets quantitatively and qualitatively verify the effectiveness of our learning scheme.",No
iccvw_2023_98,SelectNAdapt: Support Set Selection for Few-Shot Domain Adaptation.,"Generalisation of deep neural networks becomes vulnerable when distribution shifts are encountered between train (source) and test (target) domain data. Few-shot domain adaptation mitigates this issue by adapting deep neural networks pre-trained on the source domain to the target domain using a randomly selected and annotated support set from the target domain. This paper argues that randomly selecting the support set can be further improved for effectively adapting the pre-trained source models to the target domain. Alternatively, we propose SelectNAdapt, an algorithm to curate the selection of the target domain samples, which are then annotated and included in the support set. In particular, for the K-shot adaptation problem, we first leverage self-supervision to learn features of the target domain data. Then, we propose a per-class clustering scheme of the learned target domain features and select K representative target samples using a distance-based scoring function. Finally, we bring our selection setup towards a practical ground by relying on pseudo-labels for clustering semantically similar target domain samples. Our experiments show promising results on three few-shot domain adaptation benchmarks for image recognition compared to related approaches and the standard random selection.",No
iccvw_2023_99,Self-supervised Hypergraphs for Learning Multiple World Interpretations.,"We present a method for learning multiple scene representations given a small labeled set, by exploiting the relationships between such representations in the form of a multi-task hypergraph. We also show how we can use the hypergraph to improve a powerful pretrained VisTrans-former model without any additional labeled data. In our hypergraph, each node is an interpretation layer (e.g., depth or segmentation) of the scene. Within each hyperedge, one or several input nodes predict the layer at the output node. Thus, each node could be an input node in some hyperedges and an output node in others. In this way, multiple paths can reach the same node, to form ensembles from which we obtain robust pseudolabels, which allow self-supervised learning in the hypergraph. We test different ensemble models and different types of hyperedges and show superior performance to other multi-task graph models in the field. We also introduce Dronescapes, a large video dataset captured with UAVs in different complex real-world scenes, with multiple representations, suitable for multi-task learning.",No
iccvw_2023_100,MIAD: A Maintenance Inspection Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection.,"Visual anomaly detection plays a crucial role in not only manufacturing inspection to find defects of products during manufacturing processes, but also maintenance inspection to keep equipment in optimum working condition particularly outdoors. Due to the scarcity of the defective samples, unsupervised anomaly detection has attracted great attention in recent years. However, existing datasets for unsupervised anomaly detection are biased towards manufacturing inspection, not considering maintenance inspection which is usually conducted under outdoor uncontrolled environment such as varying camera viewpoints, messy background and degradation of object surface after long-term working. We focus on outdoor maintenance inspection and contribute a comprehensive Maintenance Inspection Anomaly Detection (MIAD) dataset which contains more than 100K high-resolution color images in various outdoor industrial scenarios. This dataset is generated by a 3D graphics software and covers both surface and logical anomalies with pixel-precise ground truth. Extensive evaluations of representative algorithms for unsupervised anomaly detection are conducted, and we expect MIAD and corresponding experimental results can inspire research community in outdoor unsupervised anomaly detection tasks. Worthwhile and related future work can be spawned from our new dataset.",No
iccvw_2023_101,Self-training and multi-task learning for limited data: evaluation study on object detection.,"Self-training allows a network to learn from the predictions of a more complicated model, thus often requires well-trained teacher models and mixture of teacher-student data while multi-task learning jointly optimizes different targets to learn salient interrelationship and requires multi-task annotations for each training example. These frameworks, despite being particularly data demanding have potentials for data exploitation if such assumptions can be relaxed. In this paper, we compare self-training object detection under the deficiency of teacher training data where students are trained on unseen examples by the teacher, and multi-task learning with partially annotated data, i.e. single-task annotation per training example. Both scenarios have their own limitation but potentially helpful with limited annotated data. Experimental results show the improvement of performance when using a weak teacher with unseen data for training a multi-task student. Despite the limited setup we believe the experimental results show the potential of multitask knowledge distillation and self-training, which could be beneficial for future study.

iccvw_2023_102,Augmenting Features via Contrastive Learning-based Generative Model for Long-Tailed Classification.,"Thanks to the advances in deep learning-based computer vision, image classification has shown great achievements. However, it has faced a heavy class imbalance issue which is one of the characteristics of real-world datasets. The severe class imbalance makes the classifier easily biased toward majority classes and overfitting to minority classes. To address this issue, supplementing minority classes with artificially generated samples has proven effective. In addition, contrastive learning has been introduced to improve image classification performance recently. Motivated by recent works, we propose feature augmentation via a contrastive learning-based generative model for long-tailed classification. Specifically, features are augmented using the feature dictionary obtained by real samples and the generated convex weights, which are used for learning an image classification model. Here, the model for the feature augmentation is trained based on generative adversarial learning and contrastive learning in an end-to-end manner. The generative adversarial learning helps to generate real-like features, and the contrastive learning improves the featureâ€™s discrimination power. Through extensive experiments with various long-tailed classification datasets, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",No
iccvw_2023_103,Boosting Semi-Supervised Learning by bridging high and low-confidence predictions.,"Pseudo-labeling is a crucial technique in semi-supervised learning (SSL), where artificial labels are generated for unlabeled data by a trained model, allowing for the simultaneous training of labeled and unlabeled data in a supervised setting. However, several studies have identified three main issues with pseudo-labeling-based approaches. Firstly, these methods heavily rely on predictions from the trained model, which may not always be accurate, leading to a confirmation bias problem. Secondly, the trained model may be overfitted to easy-to-learn examples, ignoring hard-to-learn ones, resulting in the ""Matthew effect"" where the already strong become stronger and the weak weaker. Thirdly, most of the low-confidence predictions of unlabeled data are discarded due to the use of a high threshold, leading to an underutilization of unlabeled data during training. To address these issues, we propose a new method called ReFixMatch, which aims to utilize all of the unlabeled data during training, thus improving the generalizability of the model and performance on SSL benchmarks. Notably, ReFixMatch achieves 41.05% top-1 accuracy with 100k labeled examples on ImageNet, outperforming the baseline FixMatch and current state-of-the-art methods.",No
iccvw_2023_104,FedLID: Self-Supervised Federated Learning for Leveraging Limited Image Data.,"This study investigates the challenging task of training visual models with very few available data, further complicated by the distribution being imbalanced and scattered across nodes. To address this diverse availability of training data in different federated settings, a customized self-supervised learning approach tailored specifically for each scenario is being proposed. In particular, a hybrid approach combining self-supervised and supervised learning techniques under a federated umbrella has been utilized at both the global and local level, harnessing the potential of unlabeled data. Extensive experiments provide a detailed analysis of the problem at hand and demonstrate the particular characteristics of the proposed learning schemes in distributed scenarios. The overall proposed approach achieves superior recognition performance in the currently broadest public dataset, surpassing all baselines by a substantial margin. The proposed solution can operate efficiently at a local level without prior knowledge of the characteristics or distribution of data across nodes.",No
iccvw_2023_105,A Horse with no Labels: Self-Supervised Horse Pose Estimation from Unlabelled Images and Synthetic Prior.,"Obtaining labelled data to train deep learning methods for estimating animal pose is challenging. Recently, synthetic data has been widely used for pose estimation tasks, but most methods still rely on supervised learning paradigms utilising synthetic images and labels. Can training be fully unsupervised? Is a tiny synthetic dataset sufficient? What are the minimum assumptions that we could make for estimating animal pose? Our proposal addresses these questions through a simple yet effective self-supervised method that only assumes the availability of unlabelled images and a small set of synthetic 2D poses. We completely remove the need for any 3D or 2D pose annotations (or complex 3D animal models), and surprisingly our approach can still learn accurate 3D and 2D poses simultaneously. We train our method with unlabelled images of horses mainly collected for YouTube videos and a prior consisting of 2D synthetic poses. The latter is three times smaller than the number of images needed for training. We test our method on a challenging set of horse images and evaluate the predicted 3D and 2D poses. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn accurate animal poses even with as few assumptions as unlabelled images and a small set of 2D poses generated from synthetic data. Given the minimum requirements and the abundance of unlabelled data, our method could be easily deployed to different animals.",No
iccvw_2023_106,Enhancing Classification Accuracy on Limited Data via Unconditional GAN.,"Despite significant advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), these models often fall short in real-world scenarios, particularly when faced with a scarcity of training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that capitalizes on the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance performance in image classification tasks. Our approach specifically involves training the classifier by enforcing a consistency rule across generated unlabeled data synthesized from unconditional GANs. Through the implementation of our proposed methodology, we observed a substantial increase in accuracy - approximately 8.68% on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the baseline (which had an accuracy of 54.54%) trained with 500 real images. This notable enhancement in accuracy demonstrates the superiority of our method using class unconditional GANs over the previous techniques aiming to enhance accuracy using class Conditional GANs.",No
iccvw_2023_107,Deep Generative Networks for Heterogeneous Augmentation of Cranial Defects.,"The design of personalized cranial implants is a challenging and tremendous task that has become a hot topic in terms of process automation with the use of deep learning techniques. The main challenge is associated with the high diversity of possible cranial defects. The lack of appropriate data sources negatively influences the data-driven nature of deep learning algorithms. Hence, one of the possible solutions to overcome this problem is to rely on synthetic data. In this work, we propose three volumetric variations of deep generative models to augment the dataset by generating synthetic skulls, i.e. Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), WGAN-GP hybrid with Variational Autoencoder pretraining (VAE/WGAN-GP) and Introspective Variational Autoencoder (IntroVAE). We show that it is possible to generate dozens of thousands of defective skulls with compatible defects that achieve a trade-off between defect heterogeneity and the realistic shape of the skull. We evaluate obtained synthetic data quantitatively by defect segmentation with the use of V-Net and qualitatively by their latent space exploration. We show that the synthetically generated skulls highly improve the segmentation process compared to using only the original unaugmented data. The generated skulls may improve the automatic design of personalized cranial implants for real medical cases.",No
iccvw_2023_108,360Â° from a Single Camera: A Few-Shot Approach for LiDAR Segmentation.,"Deep learning applications on LiDAR data suffer from a strong domain gap when applied to different sensors or tasks. In order for these methods to obtain similar accuracy on different data in comparison to values reported on public benchmarks, a large scale annotated dataset is necessary. However, in practical applications labeled data is costly and time consuming to obtain. Such factors have triggered various research in label-efficient methods, but a large gap remains to their fully-supervised counterparts. Thus, we propose ImageTo360, an effective and streamlined few-shot approach to label-efficient LiDAR segmentation. Our method utilizes an image teacher network to generate semantic predictions for LiDAR data within a single camera view. The teacher is used to pretrain the LiDAR segmentation student network, prior to optional fine-tuning on 360Â° data. Our method is implemented in a modular manner on the point level and as such is generalizable to different architectures. We improve over the current state-of-the-art results for label-efficient methods and even surpass some traditional fully-supervised segmentation networks.",No
iccvw_2023_109,Guiding Video Prediction with Explicit Procedural Knowledge.,"We propose a general way to integrate procedural knowledge of a domain into deep learning models. We apply it to the case of video prediction, building on top of object-centric deep models and show that this leads to a better performance than using data-driven models alone. We develop an architecture that facilitates latent space disentanglement in order to use the integrated procedural knowledge, and establish a setup that allows the model to learn the procedural interface in the latent space using the downstream task of video prediction. We contrast the performance to a state-of-the-art data-driven approach and show that problems where purely data-driven approaches struggle can be handled by using knowledge about the domain, providing an alternative to simply collecting more data.",No
iccvw_2023_110,G2L: A High-Dimensional Geometric Approach for Automatic Generation of Highly Accurate Pseudo-labels.,"Transfer learning is a deep-learning technique that ameliorates the problem of learning when human-annotated labels are expensive and limited. In place of such labels, it uses instead the previously trained weights from a well-chosen source model as the initial weights for the training of a base model for a new target dataset. We demonstrate a novel general technique for automatically creating such source models. We generate pseudo-labels according to an efficient and extensible algorithm that is based on a classical result from the geometry of high dimensions, the Cayley-Menger determinant. This G2L (""geometry to label"") method incrementally builds up pseudo-labels using a greedy computation of hypervolume content. We demonstrate that the method is tunable with respect to expected accuracy, which can be forecast by an information-theoretic measure of dataset similarity (divergence) between source and target. The results of 560 experiments show that this automatic technique generates base models that have similar or better transferability compared to a baseline of models trained on extensively human-annotated ImageNet1K labels, decreasing error in most divergent datasets tested.",No
iccvw_2023_111,Image Guided Inpainting with Parameter Efficient Learning.,"Conditional inpainting is the challenging task of generating images that fill in specific regions of an image while preserving the surrounding details, based on an arbitrary binary mask and a specified condition (e.g., text or image). Existing methods for conditional inpainting often struggle to preserve the appearance of the userâ€™s subject in the input images and can be computationally expensive to tune for each new condition. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to conditional inpainting that combines an Image Guided Inpainting model with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). Our approach trains the DDPM model using a small number of user-provided images, enabling users to insert a subject into any scene even if the poses and views were not present in the tuning data. We also propose a parameter-efficient method for training the DDPM that preserves its core performance while reducing the number of retrained parameters. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for use in low-resource environments. Overall, our approach offers a valuable baseline for future research on guided inpainting and personalization.",No

The ILSH dataset is intended to facilitate diverse approaches, such as scene-specific or generic neural rendering, multiple-view geometry, 3D vision, and computer graphics, to further advance the development of photo-realistic human avatars. This paper details the setup of a light-stage specifically designed to capture high-resolution (4K) human head images and describes the process of addressing challenges (preprocessing, ethical issues) in collecting high-quality data. In addition to the data collection, we address the split of the dataset into train, validation, and test sets. Our goal is to design and support a fair view synthesis challenge task for this novel dataset, such that a similar level of performance can be maintained and expected when using the test set, as when using the validation set. The ILSH dataset consists of 52 subjects captured using 24 cameras with all 82 lighting sources turned on, resulting in a total of 1,248 close-up head images, border masks, and camera pose pairs.",No

iccvw_2023_114,A Simple and Generic Framework for Feature Distillation via Channel-wise Transformation.,"Knowledge distillation is a popular technique for transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model by mimicking. However, distillation by directly aligning the feature maps between teacher and student may enforce overly strict constraints on the student thus degrading the performance of the student model. To alleviate the above feature misalignment issue, existing works mainly focus on spatially aligning the feature maps of the teacher and the student, with pixel-wise transformation. In this paper, we newly find that aligning the feature maps between teacher and student along the channel-wise dimension is also effective for addressing the feature misalignment issue. Specifically, we propose a learnable nonlinear channel-wise transformation to align the features of the student and the teacher model. Based on this idea, we propose a simple and generic framework for feature distillation, with only one hyper-parameter to balance the distillation loss and the task-specific loss. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves significant performance improvements in various computer vision tasks including image classification (+3.28% top-1 accuracy for MobileNetV1 on ImageNet-1K), object detection (+3.9% bbox mAP for ResNet50-based Faster-RCNN on MS COCO), instance segmentation (+2.8% Mask mAP for ResNet50-based Mask-RCNN), and semantic segmentation (+4.66% mIoU for ResNet18-based PSPNet in semantic segmentation on Cityscapes), which demonstrates the effectiveness and the versatility of the proposed method.",No
iccvw_2023_115,Deterministic Neural Illumination Mapping for Efficient Auto-White Balance Correction.,"Auto-white balance (AWB) correction is a critical operation in image signal processors for accurate and consistent color correction across various illumination scenarios. This paper presents a novel and efficient AWB correction method that achieves at least 35 times faster processing with equivalent or superior performance on high-resolution images for the current state-of-the-art methods. Inspired by deterministic color style transfer, our approach introduces deterministic illumination color mapping, leveraging learnable projection matrices for both canonical illumination form and AWB-corrected output. It involves feeding high-resolution images and corresponding latent representations into a mapping module to derive a canonical form, followed by another mapping module that maps the pixel values to those for the corrected version. This strategy is designed as resolution-agnostic and also enables seamless integration of any pre-trained AWB network as the backbone. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, revealing significant performance improvements and reduced time complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method provides an efficient deep learning-based AWB correction solution, promising real-time, high-quality color correction for digital imaging applications.

iccvw_2023_116,A Comprehensive Study of Transfer Learning under Constraints.,"Pre-training on an upstream task is widely used in deep learning to boost performance of downstream tasks. Recent studies analyzed pre-training with large datasets and large deep neural network architectures. However, pre-training is very useful in practice when downstream tasks have scarce data and are trained under computational constraints. To assess pre-training performance in this setting, we train different deep architectures with 1M parameters. We create different subsets of ImageNet to study the influence of upstream dataset in detail by varying the total size, but also the ratio between number of classes and samples per class for a constant total size. Then, we use the resulting models in transfer toward six diversified downstream tasks using linear probing and full fine tuning for downstream training. Experimental results confirm previous ones regarding performance saturation in downstream tasks, but we find that saturation occurs faster for compact deep architectures. The use of different ImageNet subsets leads to globally similar performance when enough data is included, regardless of the dataset structure. The comparison of downstream training strategies shows that linear probing can be competitive, particularly for few-shot settings. This is at odds with previous reports, which assert the superiority of full fine tuning. Finally, we observe that the type of deep architecture has a significant effect on results, but that their relative performance varies depending on the downstream training strategy.",No

Our Ray-Patch decoding reduces the computational footprint and increases inference speed up to one order of magnitude compared to previous models, without losing global attention, and hence maintaining specific task metrics. The key idea of our novel querying is to split the target image into a set of patches, then querying the transformer for each patch to extract a set of feature vectors, which are finally decoded into the target image using convolutional layers. Our experimental results quantify the effectiveness of our method, specifically the notable boost in rendering speed for the same task metrics.",No

Real-time video frame classification is a perfect example of energy-intensive task that could present battery consumption and overheating issues on embedded devices. In this paper we propose a novel architecture to tackle this problem efficiently, exploiting temporal redundancies between consecutive frames. The model consists of two convolutional neural network streams with different parameter sizes and input resolutions. Each frame is processed by only one of the streams, and the stream with the lowest input resolution and parameter size uses saliency maps generated by the other stream on a previous frame. The energy consumption can be manually controlled by choosing a proper schedule of the two streams. We show the effectiveness of our proposed architecture in a task that involves recognizing the state of the relevant traffic lights in images from on-board cameras.",No

We collect accuracy and latency numbers for a variety of YOLO-based one-stage detectors at different model scales by performing a fair, controlled comparison of these detectors with a fixed training environment (code and training hyperparameters). Pareto-optimality analysis of the collected data reveals that, if modern detection heads and training techniques are incorporated into the learning process, multiple architectures of the YOLO series achieve a good accuracy-latency trade-off, including older models like YOLOv3 and YOLOv4. We also evaluate training-free accuracy estimators used in neural architecture search on YOLOBench and demonstrate that, while most state-of-the-art zero-cost accuracy estimators are outperformed by a simple baseline like MAC count, some of them can be effectively used to predict Pareto-optimal detection models. We showcase that by using a zero-cost proxy to identify a YOLO architecture competitive against a state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model on a Raspberry Pi 4 CPU.

iccvw_2023_120,Accelerating Deep Neural Networks via Semi-Structured Activation Sparsity.,"The demand for efficient processing of deep neural networks (DNNs) on embedded devices is a significant challenge limiting their deployment. Exploiting sparsity in the networkâ€™s feature maps is one of the ways to reduce its inference latency. It is known that unstructured sparsity results in lower accuracy degradation with respect to structured sparsity but the former needs extensive inference engine changes to get latency benefits. To tackle this challenge, we propose a solution to induce semi-structured activation sparsity exploitable through minor runtime modifications. To attain high speedup levels at inference time, we design a sparse training procedure with awareness of the final position of the activations while computing the General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). We extensively evaluate the proposed solution across various models for image classification and object detection tasks. Remarkably, our approach yields a speed improvement of 1.25Ã— with a minimal accuracy drop of 1.1% for the ResNet18 model on the ImageNet dataset.

iccvw_2023_121,Revisiting Kernel Temporal Segmentation as an Adaptive Tokenizer for Long-form Video Understanding.,"While most modern video understanding models operate on short-range clips, real-world videos are often several minutes long with semantically-consistent segments of variable length. A common approach to process long videos is applying a short-form video model over uniformly sampled clips of fixed temporal length and aggregating the outputs. This approach neglects the underlying nature of long videos since fixed-length clips are often redundant or uninformative. In this paper, we aim to provide a generic and adaptive sampling approach for long-form videos in lieu of the de facto uniform sampling. Viewing videos as semantically-consistent segments, we formulate a task-agnostic, unsupervised, and scalable approach based on Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) for sampling and tokenizing long videos. We evaluate our method on long-form video understanding tasks such as video classification and temporal action localization, showing consistent gains over existing approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-form video modeling.",No

However, as deep learning models continue to grow in scale and complexity, optimizing their hyperparameters for efficient resource utilization becomes a critical challenge. Traditional optimization techniques often assume smooth and continuous loss functions, limiting their effectiveness in this context. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven approach to hyperparameter optimization using a convex quadrature surrogate. By leveraging a set of sampled hyperparameters and their corresponding performance, our method fits a multivariate quadratic surrogate model to identify the optimal hyperparameters. We demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach by improving the efficiency and performance of various hyperparameter strategies on both closed and open set benchmarks across diverse vision and tabular datasets. Additionally, we showcase its applicability in automatic target recognition tasks. This research contributes to the broader objective of resource-efficient deep learning for computer vision, fostering advancements in model efficiency, computational memory constraints, and latency considerations.

iccvw_2023_123,"When Layers Play the Lottery, all Tickets Win at Initialization.","Pruning is a standard technique for reducing the computational cost of deep networks. Many advances in pruning leverage concepts from the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH). LTH reveals that inside a trained dense network exists sparse subnetworks (tickets) able to achieve similar accuracy (i.e., win the lottery â€“ winning tickets). Pruning at initialization focuses on finding winning tickets without training a dense network. Studies on these concepts share the trend that subnetworks come from weight or filter pruning. In this work, we investigate LTH and pruning at initialization from the lens of layer pruning. First, we confirm the existence of winning tickets when the pruning process removes layers. Leveraged by this observation, we propose to discover these winning tickets at initialization, eliminating the requirement of heavy computational resources for training the initial (over-parameterized) dense network. Extensive experiments show that our winning tickets notably speed up the training phase and reduce up to 51% of carbon emission, an important step towards democratization and green Artificial Intelligence. Beyond computational benefits, our winning tickets exhibit robustness against adversarial and out-of-distribution examples. Finally, we show that our subnetworks easily win the lottery at initialization while tickets from filter removal (the standard structured LTH) hardly become winning tickets.",Yes

The learnt module can be used as a plug-in with any 3D CNN action recognition model with clip-level processing. We propose to use relevant motion clues from video frames to adaptively learn input-clip optimal transformations, as these clues are hypothesized to be directly related to the action recognition task. We employ differentiable transformations and samplers and ensure end-to-end system differentiability. We render the proposed module light-weight and computationally efficient, by exploiting the motion information inherently present in compressed videos and readily available at both training and inference time. Highly informative motion-related content of compressed video domain modalities helps further boost action recognition accuracy. Our experimental work demonstrates clear benefits of the proposed method for adaptive spatial zooming and of utilizing the compressed domain for that purpose.",No
iccvw_2023_125,Shapley Deep Learning: A Consensus for General-Purpose Vision Systems.,"Shapely Deep Learning (SDL) targets a new foundation for the design of general-purpose vision systems, by establishing a consensus method that facilitates self-adaptation and flexibility to deal with new computer vision tasks. Today, machine learning did not yet reach the flexible, general-purpose intelligence that biological vision has in mimicking visual descriptions and learning in general-purpose vision algorithms. Currently, each model is built using the domain knowledge of the application in question. Data scientists must consequently be well-versed in the relevant subject. This paper presents SDL as a consensus method for general-purpose intelligence without the help of a domain expert as the trained model has been developed utilizing a general deep learning approach that investigates the contribution of each model in the training process. First, several deep learning models have been trained for each image. The shapley value is then determined to compute the contribution of each subset of models in the training. The model selection is finally performed based on the shapley value and the joint model cost. Optimization of the shapley computation is also carried out by investigating the banzhaf function. We present the evaluation of the generality of SDL using the computer vision benchmarks: MNIST for Shapley value performance, ImageNet for image classification, and COCO for object detection. The results reveal the effectiveness of SDL in terms of accuracy and competitiveness of inference runtime. Concretely, SDL achieved 10%, and 8% over MViTv2 for classification, and object detection tasks, respectively.",No
iccvw_2023_126,HyperSparse Neural Networks: Shifting Exploration to Exploitation through Adaptive Regularization.,"Sparse neural networks are a key factor in developing resource-efficient machine learning applications. We propose the novel and powerful sparse learning method Adaptive Regularized Training (ART) to compress dense into sparse networks. Instead of the commonly used binary mask during training to reduce the number of model weights, we inherently shrink weights close to zero in an iterative manner with increasing weight regularization. Our method compresses the pre-trained model ""knowledge"" into the weights of highest magnitude. Therefore, we introduce a novel regularization loss named HyperSparse that exploits the highest weights while conserving the ability of weight exploration. Extensive experiments on CIFAR and TinyImageNet show that our method leads to notable performance gains compared to other sparsification methods, especially in extremely high sparsity regimes up to 99.8% model sparsity. Additional investigations provide new insights into the patterns that are encoded in weights with high magnitudes.1",No

This construction exploits an inherent spatial redundancy of the learned convolutional filters to enable a much greater parameter efficiency, while maintaining the top-end accuracy of their dense counter-parts. Training these networks is modelled as a generalised pruning problem, whereby the pruned filters are replaced with cheap transformations from the set of non-pruned filters. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed layer, followed by two natural extensions to avoid excessive feature compression and to improve the expressivity of the transformed features.

iccvw_2023_128,"Enhancing Differentiable Architecture Search: A Study on Small Number of Cell Blocks in the Search Stage, and Important Branches-based Cells Selection.","In recent years, differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) method has attracted a lot of attention. This method has been proposed to reduce the search cost incurred when using reinforcement learning and evolutionary search strategies. Although several studies have been carried out to improve its performance, most of these existing methods share some common limitations: They use a stack of five to eight cells during the search process to find only two distinct cells. The usage of several cells significantly increases the computation cost of the search process. In this paper, to reduce the search time, we propose to decouple the structure of the architecture used during the search of optimal pair of cells from the final architecture by using only one normal and one reduction cells search architecture during the search stage and the same architecture structure as DARTS during the evaluation stage. We also address the stability and performance drop trade-off by inserting additional residual connection in parallel with every normal cell block. Additionally, adding A convolution skip connection to the evaluation architecture has been shown to improve the performance. Finally, we investigated the effect of searching optimal cellâ€™s operation from highly performing branches in the internal structure of every cell. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method significantly reduces the search cost while achieving promising results on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on DARTS search space.",No
iccvw_2023_129,CoroNetGAN: Controlled Pruning of GANs via Hypernetworks.,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to exhibit remarkable performance and are widely used across many generative computer vision applications. However, the unprecedented demand for the deployment of GANs on resource-constrained edge devices still poses a challenge due to huge number of parameters involved in the generation process. This has led to focused attention on the area of compressing GANs. Most of the existing works use knowledge distillation with the overhead of teacher dependency. Moreover, there is no ability to control the degree of compression in these methods. Hence, we propose CoroNet-GAN for compressing GAN using the combined strength of differentiable pruning method via hypernetworks. The proposed method provides the advantage of performing controllable compression while training along with reducing training time by a substantial factor. Experiments have been done on various conditional GAN architectures (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN) to signify the effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets such as Edges â†’ Shoes, Horse â†” Zebra and Summer â†’ Winter. The results obtained illustrate that our approach succeeds to outperform the baselines on Zebra â†’ Horse and Summer â†’ Winter achieving the best FID score of 32.3 and 72.3 respectively, yielding high-fidelity images across all the datasets.

iccvw_2023_130,Developing Robust and Lightweight Adversarial Defenders by Enforcing Orthogonality on Attack-Agnostic Denoising Autoencoders.,"Adversarial attacks have become a critical threat to the security and reliability of machine learning models. We propose a solution to the problem of defending against adversarial attacks using a deep Denoising Auto Encoder (DAE). The proposed DAE is trained to enforce orthogonality between the noise and the range space of its output in each layer of the encoderâ€™s chain. Furthermore, the pseudoinverse decoder of the DAE is designed to ensure that the reconstructed image and the null space of its intermediate representations in each layer of the chain maintain orthogonality as it progresses from the target space to the latent space. The denoising problem is formulated as an equality constrained optimization problem, which is solved by finding the stationary points of the Lagrangian function. The noisy data are generated by adding realizations of multiple random noise distributions to pristine data during DAE training, resulting in excellent denoising performance. We compare the performance of our full weights and tied-weights DAEs, showing that the latter not only has half the complexity of the former, but also outperforms the former in denoising and in strong adversarial attacks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution we evaluate our networks against recent works in the literature, specifically those focusing on defending against adversarial attacks.",Yes
iccvw_2023_131,QBitOpt: Fast and Accurate Bitwidth Reallocation during Training.,"Quantizing neural networks is one of the most effective methods for achieving efficient inference on mobile and embedded devices. In particular, mixed precision quantized (MPQ) networks, whose layers can be quantized to different bitwidths, achieve better task performance for the same resource constraint compared to networks with homogeneous bitwidths. However, finding the optimal bitwidth allocation is a challenging problem as the search space grows exponentially with the number of layers in the network. In this paper, we propose QBitOpt, a novel algorithm for updating bitwidths during quantization-aware training (QAT). We formulate the bitwidth allocation problem as a constraint optimization problem. By combining fast-to-compute sensitivities with efficient solvers during QAT, QBitOpt can produce mixed-precision networks with high task performance guaranteed to satisfy strict resource constraints. This contrasts with existing mixed-precision methods that learn bitwidths using gradients and cannot provide such guarantees. We evaluate QBitOpt on ImageNet and confirm we outperform fixed-precision methods. We also achieve comparable accuracy to other mixed-precision methods, while always meeting the exact resource constraint without the need for hyper-parameter search over regularization strength.",No
iccvw_2023_132,MGiaD: Multigrid in all dimensions. Efficiency and robustness by weight sharing and coarsening in resolution and channel dimensions.,"Current state-of-the-art deep neural networks for image classification are made up of 10â€“100 million learnable parameters, i.e. weights. Despite their high classification accuracy these networks are heavily overparameterized. The complexity of the weight count can be considered as a function of the number of channels, the spatial extent of the input and the number of layers of the network. Due to the use of convolutional layers the scaling of weight complexity is usually linear with regard to the resolution dimensions, but remains quadratic with respect to the number of channels. Active research in recent years in terms of using multigrid inspired ideas in deep neural networks have shown that on one hand a significant number of weights can be saved by appropriate weight sharing and on the other that a hierarchical structure in the channel dimension can improve the weight complexity to linear. Utilizing these findings, we introduce an architecture that establishes multigrid structures in all relevant dimensions, contributing a drastically improved accuracy-parameter trade-off. Our experiments show that this structured reduction in weight count reduces overparameterization and additionally improves performance over state-of-the-art ResNet architectures on typical image classification benchmarks.",No
iccvw_2023_133,Accumulation Knowledge Distillation for Conditional GAN Compression.,"This paper focuses on an efficient and high-performance compression method for conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) from the perspective of knowledge distillation. Previous cGANs compression approaches using knowledge distillation typically transfer knowledge in a one-to-one manner, where a specific student generator layer only receives knowledge from the same depth stage in the teacher generator. Obviously, this approach fails to sufficiently explore the valuable dark knowledge embedded in the intermediate teacher generator layers. To address this issue, a novel cGANs compression method based on accumulation knowledge distillation (ACKD) is proposed. ACKD accumulates knowledge from various teacher generator stages then transfers it to the student generator. To this end, ACKD first extracts the essential knowledge from different stages and subsequently unifies them to determine their relative importance. In this manner, ACKD is capable of effectively providing hierarchical, informative and targeted knowledge to the compressed student generator. The compressed cGANs achieved by ACKD demonstrate remarkable performance surpassing other other state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks. Furthermore, ACKD compresses parameters over 100Ã— and MACs over 50Ã—, setting new records in cGANs compression.",No

However, tailoring SOTA Face Recognition solutions to a specific edge device is still not easy and is vastly unexplored. Although, benchmark data is available for some combinations of model, device, and framework, it is neither comprehensive nor scalable. We propose an approximation to determine the relationship between a model and its inference time in an edge deployment scenario. Using a small number of data points, we are able to predict the throughput of custom models in an explainable manner. The prediction errors are small enough to be considered noise in observations. We also analyze which approaches are most efficient and make better use of hardware in terms of accuracy and error rates to gain a better understanding of their behaviour.

iccvw_2023_135,MOFA: A Model Simplification Roadmap for Image Restoration on Mobile Devices.,"Image restoration aims to restore high-quality images from degraded counterparts and has seen significant advancements through deep learning techniques. The technique has been widely applied to mobile devices for tasks such as mobile photography. Given the resource limitations on mobile devices, such as memory constraints and runtime requirements, the efficiency of models during deployment becomes paramount. Nevertheless, most previous works have primarily concentrated on analyzing the efficiency of single modules and improving them individually. This paper examines the efficiency across different layers. We propose a roadmap that can be applied to further accelerate image restoration models prior to deployment while simultaneously increasing PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index). The roadmap first increases the model capacity by adding more parameters to partial convolutions on FLOPs nonsensitive layers. Then, it applies partial depthwise convolution coupled with decoupling upsampling/downsampling layers to accelerate the model speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach decreases runtime by up to 13% and reduces the number of parameters by up to 23%, while increasing PSNR and SSIM on several image restoration datasets.

Specifically, we propose an efficient supernet-based neural architecture search (NAS) method that uses search space pruning. The search space defined by the supernet is pruned by removing candidate models that are predicted to perform poorly. To effectively remove the candidates over a wide range of resource constraints, we particularly design a performance predictor for supernet, called path filter, which is conditioned by resource constraints and can accurately predict the relative performance of the models that satisfy similar resource constraints. Hence, super-net training is more focused on the best-performing candidates. Our path filter handles prediction for paths with different resource budgets. Compared to once-for-all, our proposed method reduces the computational cost of the optimal network architecture by 30% and 63%, while yielding better accuracy-floating point operations Pareto front (0.85 and 0.45 points of improvement on average precision for Pascal VOC and COCO, respectively).",No
iccvw_2023_137,Post Training Mixed Precision Quantization of Neural Networks using First-Order Information.,"Quantization is an efficient way of downsizing both memory footprints and inference time of large size Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and makes their application feasible on resource-constrained devices. However, quantizing all layers uniformly with ultra-low precision bits results in significant degradation in performance. A promising approach to address this problem is mixed-precision quantization where higher bit precisions are assigned to layers that are more sensitive. In this study, we introduce the method that uses first-order information (i.e. gradient) only for determining the neural network layersâ€™ sensitivity for mixed-precision quantization and shows that the proposed method is equally effective in performance and better in computation complexity with its counterpart methods which use second order information (i.e. hessian). Finally, we formulate the mixed precision problem as an Integer linear programming problem which uses proposed sensitivity metric and allocate the number of bits for each layer efficiently for a given model size. Furthermore, we only use post training quantization techniques to achieve the state of the art results in comparison to the popular methods for mixed precision quantization which fine-tunes the model with large training data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark vision neural network architectures using ImageNet dataset demonstrates the superiority over existing mixed-precision approaches. Our proposed method achieves better or comparable results for ResNet18 (0.65% accuracy-drop, for 8Ã— weight compression), ResNet50 (0.69% accuracy-drop, for 8Ã— weight compression), MobileNet-V2 (0.49% accuracy-drop, for 8Ã— weight compression) and Inception-V3 (1.30% accuracy-drop, for 8Ã— weight compression), compared to other state-of-the-art methods which requires retraining or uses hessian as a sensitivity metric for mixed precision quantization.",No

Despite the success on image classification, the effectiveness of zero-shot proxies is rarely evaluated on complex vision tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. Moreover, existing zero-shot proxies are shown to be biased towards certain model characteristics which restricts their broad applicability. In this paper, we empirically study the bias of state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot proxy ZiCo across multiple vision tasks and observe that ZiCo is biased towards thinner and deeper networks, leading to sub-optimal architectures. To solve the problem, we propose a novel bias correction on ZiCo, called ZiCo-BC.

To lower this cost, model cascades use an expensive encoder to refine the ranking of a cheap encoder. However, existing cascading algorithms focus on cross-encoders, which jointly process text-image pairs, but do not consider cascades of bi-encoders, which separately process texts and images. We introduce the small-world search scenario as a realistic setting where bi-encoder cascades can reduce costs. We then propose a cascading algorithm that leverages the small-world search scenario to reduce lifetime image encoding costs of a TIR system. Our experiments show cost reductions by up to 6x.",No

Operations such as edge detection, image enhancement, and super-resolution, provide the foundations for higher level image analysis. In this work we address the edge detection considering three main objectives: simplicity, efficiency, and generalization since current state-of-the-art (SOTA) edge detection models are increased in complexity for better accuracy. To achieve this, we present Tiny and Efficient Edge Detector (TEED), a light convolutional neural network with only 58K parameters, less than 0.2% of the state-of-the-art models.

In this paper, we present the next-generation neural architecture design for computationally efficient neural architecture distillation - DONNAv2 . Conventional NAS algorithms rely on a computationally extensive stage where an accuracy predictor is learned to estimate model performance within search space. This building of accuracy predictors helps them predict the performance of models that are not being finetuned. Here, we have developed an elegant approach to eliminate building the accuracy predictor and extend DONNA to a computationally efficient setting. The loss metric of individual blocks forming the network serves as the surrogate performance measure for the sampled models in the NAS search stage. To validate the performance of DONNAv2 we have performed extensive experiments involving a range of diverse vision tasks including classification, object detection, image denoising, super-resolution, and panoptic perception network (YOLOP). The hardware-in-the-loop experiments were carried out using the Samsung Galaxy S10 mobile platform. Notably, DONNAv2 reduces the computational cost of DONNA by 10x for the larger datasets. Furthermore, to improve the quality of NAS search space, DONNAv2 leverages a block knowledge distillation filter to remove blocks with high inference costs.",No

Partitions having the same overall population size or even the same number of samples per class may still have Non-IID distribution in the feature space. In heterogeneous computing environments, when devices have different computing capabilities, even-sized partitions across devices can lead to the straggler problem in distributed SGD. We develop a framework for distributed SGD in heterogeneous environments based on a novel data partitioning algorithm involving submodular optimization. Our data partitioning algorithm explicitly accounts for resource heterogeneity across workers while achieving similar class-level feature distribution and maintaining class balance. Based on this algorithm, we develop a distributed SGD framework that can accelerate existing SOTA distributed training algorithms by up to 32%.",No

That is why it is hard to adapt a neural network to the constraints of hardware, especially at the edge. This paper presents an investigation into a novel approach for activation compression, which we term â€™Projection-based compression on channelsâ€™ or â€™ProChanâ€™. Our method involves interposing projection layers into a pretrained network around the nonlinearity, reducing the channel dimensionality through compression operations and then expanding it back. Our module is made to be then totally fused with the convolutions around it, guaranteeing no overhead, and maximum FLOPs reduction. We studied its absorption of the cost of quantization, to combine the two approaches for footprint reduction. Our findings indicate that the projections likely perform an â€™adaptive stretchingâ€™ operation on the feature space, enabling the preservation of essential information when constrained by dimensional limitations.

Distillation from a trained source model may represent a solution for the first but does not account for the different distribution of the training data. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques claim to solve the domain shift, but in most cases assume the availability of the source data or an accessible white-box source model, which in practical applications are often unavailable for commercial and/or safety reasons. In this paper, we investigate a more challenging setting in which a lightweight model has to be trained on a target unlabelled dataset for semantic segmentation, under the assumption that we have access only to black-box source model predictions. Our method, named CoRTe, consists of (i) a pseudo-labelling function that extracts reliable knowledge from the black-box source model using its relative confidence, (ii) a pseudo label refinement method to retain and enhance the novel information learned by the student model on the target data, and (iii) a consistent training of the model using the extracted pseudo labels.

Moreover, the computational cost of fine-tuning is high when the model is optimized for a downstream task. Therefore, our goal is to compress the large pre-trained models with minimal performance degradation before fine-tuning. In this paper, we first present the preliminary experimental results on the parameter change by using pre-trained or scratch models when training in a downstream task. We found that the parameter magnitudes of pre-trained models remained largely unchanged before and after training compared with scratch models. With this in mind, we propose an unstructured pruning method for pre-trained models. Our method evaluates the parameters without training and prunes in a single shot to obtain sparse models.

However, this can lead to a significant runtime and power overhead during inference on resource-constraint edge devices. In this work, we investigate the source of the softmax sensitivity to quantization and show that the quantization operation leads to a large bias in the softmax output, causing accuracy degradation. To overcome this issue, we propose an offline bias correction technique that improves the quatizability of softmax without additional compute during deployment, as it can be readily absorbed into the quantization parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on stable diffusion v1.5 and 125M-size OPT language model, achieving significant accuracy improvement for 8-bit quantized softmax.",No
iccvw_2023_151,Entropic Score metric: Decoupling Topology and Size in Training-free NAS.,"Neural Networks design is a complex and often daunting task, particularly for resource-constrained scenarios typical of mobile-sized models. Neural Architecture Search is a promising approach to automate this process, but existing competitive methods require large training time and computational resources to generate accurate models. To overcome these limits, this paper contributes with: i) a novel training-free metric, named Entropic Score, to estimate model expressivity through the aggregated element-wise entropy of its activations; ii) a cyclic search algorithm to separately yet synergistically search model size and topology. Entropic Score shows remarkable ability in searching for the topology of the network, and a proper combination with LogSynflow, to search for model size, yields superior capability to completely design high-performance Hybrid Transformers for edge applications in less than 1 GPU hour, resulting in the fastest and most accurate NAS method for ImageNet classification.

iccvw_2023_152,Fast Object Detection in High-Resolution Videos.,"Despite the rapid evolution of video resolutions and progress on object detection algorithms, processing high resolution videos has had three main challenges so far. Firstly, it is non-trivial to use existing tracking algorithms to extend an object detection framework for efficient processing of high resolution videos. In theory, fully convolutional CNN architectures in most existing deep learning models allow any input resolution to be processed. However, in practice, inferencing on high resolution images decoded from a video incurs significant computational costs, making it impractical for real-time applications. Secondly, most tracking approaches typically require the entire frame to be decoded. Relatively little work has gone into object detection directly on compressed data, which include rich temporal cues that can be exploited to reduce the computational cost at inference time. Thirdly, most of these approaches require labeled data for training models, thereby limiting their adoption.We tackle all the three challenges in our framework by incorporating forward and backward motion cues from the compressed video to dramatically increase the processing speed of a pretrained baseline object detector, without any loss of accuracy. Our training is based on knowledge transfer from the baseline detector as a teacher network, thereby forgoing the need for any labeled data. Finally, the models are agnostic to teacher network architecture, and can be used to improve efficiency of any object detector. Our results show a speed gain of 3x to 20x compared to a frame-by-frame detector, depending upon input data resolution.",No
iccvw_2023_153,Extending TrOCR for Text Localization-Free OCR of Full-Page Scanned Receipt Images.,"Digitization of scanned receipts aims to extract text from receipt images and save it into structured documents. This is usually split into two sub-tasks: text localization and optical character recognition (OCR). Most existing OCR models only focus on the cropped text instance images, which require the bounding box information provided by a text region detection model. Introducing an additional detector to identify the text instance images in advance adds complexity, however instance-level OCR models have very low accuracy when processing the whole image for the document-level OCR, such as receipt images containing multiple text lines arranged in various layouts. To this end, we propose a localization-free document-level OCR model for transcribing all the characters in a receipt image into an ordered sequence end-to-end. Specifically, we finetune the pretrained instance-level model TrOCR with randomly cropped image chunks, and gradually increase the image chunk size to generalize the recognition ability from instance images to full-page images. In our experiments on the SROIE receipt OCR dataset, the model finetuned with our strategy achieved 64.4 F1-score and a 22.8% character error rate (CER), respectively, which outperforms the baseline results with 48.5 F1-score and 50.6% CER. The best model, which splits the full image into 15 equally sized chunks, gives 87.8 F1-score and 4.98% CER with minimal additional pre or post-processing of the output. Moreover, the characters in the generated document-level sequences are arranged in the reading order, which is practical for real-world applications.",No

iccvw_2023_155,Lightweight Vision Transformer with Spatial and Channel Enhanced Self-Attention.,"Due to the large number of parameters and high computational complexity, Vision Transformer (ViT) is not suitable for deployment on mobile devices. As a result, the design of efficient vision transformer models has become the focus of many studies. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called Spatial and Channel Enhanced Self-Attention (SCSA) for lightweight vision transformers. Specially, we utilize multi-head self-attention and convolutional attention in parallel to extract global spatial features and local spatial features, respectively. Subsequently, a fusion module based on channel attention effectively combines the extracted features from both global and local contexts. Based on SCSA, we introduce the Spatial and Channel enhanced Attention Transformer (SCAT). On the ImageNet-1k dataset, SCAT achieves a top-1 accuracy of 76.6% with approximately 4.9M parameters and 0.7G FLOPs, outperforming state-of-the-art Vision Transformer architectures when the number of parameters and FLOPs are similar.",No
iccvw_2023_156,Dynamic Neural Network is All You Need: Understanding the Robustness of Dynamic Mechanisms in Neural Networks.,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been used to solve different day-to-day problems. Recently, DNNs have been deployed in real-time systems, and lowering the energy consumption and response time has become the need of the hour. To address this scenario, researchers have proposed incorporating dynamic mechanism to static DNNs (SDNN) to create Dynamic Neural Networks (DyNNs) performing dynamic amounts of computation based on the input complexity. Although incorporating dynamic mechanism into SDNNs would be preferable in real-time systems, it also becomes important to evaluate how the introduction of dynamic mechanism impacts the robustness of the models. However, there has not been a significant number of works focusing on the robustness trade-off between SDNNs and DyNNs. To address this issue, we propose to investigate the robustness of dynamic mechanism in DyNNs and how dynamic mechanism design impacts the robustness of DyNNs. For that purpose, we evaluate three research questions. These evaluations are performed on three models and two datasets. Through the studies, we find that attack transferability from DyNNs to SDNNs is higher than attack transferability from SDNNs to DyNNs. Also, we find that DyNNs can be used to generate adversarial samples more efficiently than SDNNs. Then, through research studies, we provide insight into the design choices that can increase robustness of DyNNs against the attack generated using static model. Finally, we propose a novel attack to understand the additional attack surface introduced by the dynamic mechanism and provide design choices to improve robustness against the attack.",Yes
iccvw_2023_157,AntiNODE: Evaluating Efficiency Robustness of Neural ODEs.,"Recently, Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) models have been proposed, which use ordinary differential equation solving to predict the output of neural networks. Due to Neural ODE modelsâ€™ noticeably lower parameter usage compared to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and higher robustness against gradient-based attacks, they are being adopted in many type of real-time applications. For real-time applications, response-time (latency) has paramount importance due to the convenience of the user. Through our observation, we find that the latency during Neural ODE inference can be highly dynamic and sometimes detrimental to the system due to the adaptive nature of the ODE solvers. Because of that reason, understanding and evaluating efficiency robustness of Neural ODE models is needed, which has not received much attention yet. However, evaluating efficiency robustness of any model is dependent on the relationship between input and latency, which has not been defined yet for Neural ODE models. In this work, we first formulate the relationship between input and dynamic latency consumption of Neural ODEs. Based on the formulation, we propose AntiNODE, which generates latency-surging adversarial inputs for Neural ODEs by increasing the computations in Neural ODEs. We evaluate AntiNODE on two popular datasets and three ODE solvers on both hardware dependent and independent metrics. Results show that the adversarial inputs generated by AntiNODE can decrease up to 335% efficiency during inference. Our evaluation also shows that the generated adversarial inputs are transferable across multiple solvers and multiple architectures, which indicates the feasibility of black-box attack.",Yes

Entropy-based Pruning in Deep Neural Networks for Transfer Learning under Extreme Memory and Computation Budgets.,"Deep neural networks have become the de-facto standard across various computer science domains.

This paper investigates the efficacy of pruned deep learning models in transfer learning scenarios under extremely low memory budgets, tailored for TinyML models. Our study reveals that the source taskâ€™s model with the highest activation entropy outperforms others in the target task. Motivated by this, we propose an entropy-based Efficient Neural Transfer with Reduced Overhead via PrunIng (ENTROPI) algorithm. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse models (ResNet18 and MobileNet-v3) and target datasets (CIFAR-100, VLCS, and PACS), we substantiate the superior generalization achieved by transfer learning from the entropy-pruned model. Quantitative measures for entropy provide valuable insights into the reasons behind the observed performance improvements.

iccvw_2023_159,InstaTune: Instantaneous Neural Architecture Search During Fine-Tuning.,"One-Shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms often rely on training a hardware agnostic super-network for a domain specific task. Optimal sub-networks are then extracted from the trained super-network for different hardware platforms. However, training super-networks from scratch can be extremely time consuming and compute intensive especially for large models that rely on a two-stage training process of pre-training and fine-tuning. State of the art pre-trained models are available for a wide range of tasks, but their large sizes significantly limits their applicability on various hardware platforms. We propose InstaTune, a method that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained weights for large models and generates a super-network during the fine-tuning stage. InstaTune has multiple benefits. Firstly, since the process happens during fine-tuning, it minimizes the overall time and compute resources required for NAS. Secondly, the sub-networks extracted are optimized for the target task, unlike prior work that optimizes on the pre-training objective. Finally, InstaTune is easy to ""plug and play"" in existing frameworks. By using multi-objective evolutionary search algorithms along with lightly trained predictors, we find Pareto-optimal sub-networks that outperform their respective baselines across different performance objectives such as accuracy and MACs. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach performs well across both unimodal (ViT and BERT) and multi-modal (BEiT-3) transformer based architectures.",No
iccvw_2023_160,Quantized Generative Models for Solving Inverse Problems.,"Generative priors have been shown to be highly successful in solving inverse problems. In this paper, we consider quantized generative models i.e., the generator network weights come from a learnt finite alphabet. Quantized neural networks are efficient in terms of memory and computation. They are ideally suited for deployment in a practical setting involving low-precision hardware. In this paper, we solve non-linear inverse problems using quantized generative models. We introduce a new meta-learning framework that makes use of proximal operators and jointly optimizes the quantized weights of the generative model, parameters of the sensing network, and the latent-space representation. Experimental validation is carried out using standard datasets â€“ MNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN, and STL10. The results show that the performance of 32-bit networks can be achieved using 4-bit networks. The performance of 1-bit networks is about 0.7 to 2 dB inferior, while saving significantly (32Ã—) on the model size.",No

iccvw_2023_162,Scalable MAV Indoor Reconstruction with Neural Implicit Surfaces.,"Many previous works achieved impressive reconstruction results on room-scale indoor scenes from multi-view RGB images, but capturing and reconstructing multistory, complex indoor scenes is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a fully automated pipeline for reconstructing large and complex indoor scenes with drone-captured RGB images. First, we leverage traditional structure-from-motion methods to obtain camera poses and reconstruct an initial point cloud. Next, we devise a divide-and-conquer strategy to utilize neural surface reconstruction under the Manhattan-world assumption. Our method reduces the point cloudâ€™s outliers and significantly improves reconstruction quality on low-textured regions. We simultaneously predict point-wise semantic logits for walls, floors, and ceilings. The semantic segmentation enables category-wise plane fitting and improves reconstruction quality on polygonal geometry. To validate our method, we use a drone to capture videos inside a large-scale, complex indoor scene. Experimental results showed our method achieved better PSNR in view synthesis tasks and higher floor plan IOU than traditional reconstruction solutions such as COLMAP.",No
iccvw_2023_163,"PanoStyle: Semantic, Geometry-Aware and Shading Independent Photorealistic Style Transfer for Indoor Panoramic Scenes.","While current style transfer models have achieved impressive results for the application of artistic style to generic images, they face challenges in achieving photorealistic performances on indoor scenes, especially the ones represented by panoramic images. Moreover, existing models overlook the unique characteristics of indoor panoramas, which possess particular geometry and semantic properties. To address these limitations, we propose the first geometry-aware and shading-independent, photorealistic and semantic style transfer method for indoor panoramic scenes. Our approach extends semantic-aware generative adversarial architecture capabilities by introducing two novel strategies to account the geometric characteristics of indoor scenes and to enhance performance. Firstly, we incorporate strong geometry losses that use layout and depth inference at the training stage to enforce shape consistency between generated and ground truth scenes. Secondly, we apply a shading decomposition scheme to extract the albedo and normalized shading signal from the original scenes, and we apply the style transfer on albedo instead of full RGB images, thereby preventing shading-related bleeding issues. On top of that, we apply super-resolution to the resulting scenes to improve image quality and yield fine details. We evaluate our modelâ€™s performance on public domain synthetic data sets. Our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art style transfer models in terms of perceptual and accuracy metrics, achieving a 26.76% lower ArtFID, a 6.95% higher PSNR, and a 25.23% higher SSIM. The visual results show that our method is effective in producing realistic and visually pleasing indoor scenes.",No
iccvw_2023_164,MARL: Multi-scale Archetype Representation Learning for Urban Building Energy Modeling.,"Building archetypes, representative models of building stock, are crucial for precise energy simulations in Urban Building Energy Modeling. The current widely adopted building archetypes are developed on a nationwide scale, potentially neglecting the impact of local buildingsâ€™ geometric specificities. We present Multi-scale Archetype Representation Learning (MARL), an approach that leverages representation learning to extract geometric features from a specific building stock. Built upon VQ-AE, MARL encodes building footprints and purifies geometric information into latent vectors constrained by multiple architectural downstream tasks. These tailored representations are proven valuable for further clustering and building energy modeling. The advantages of our algorithm are its adaptability with respect to the different building footprint sizes, the ability for automatic generation across multi-scale regions, and the preservation of geometric features across neighborhoods and local ecologies. In our study spanning five regions in LA County, we show MARL surpasses both conventional and VQ-AE extracted archetypes in performance. Results demonstrate that geometric feature embeddings significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of energy consumption estimates.

iccvw_2023_165,SSIG: A Visually-Guided Graph Edit Distance for Floor Plan Similarity.,"We propose a simple yet effective metric that measures structural similarity between visual instances of architectural floor plans, without the need for learning. Qualitatively, our experiments show that the retrieval results are similar to deeply learned methods. Effectively comparing instances of floor plan data is paramount to the success of machine understanding of floor plan data, including the assessment of floor plan generative models and floor plan recommendation systems. Comparing visual floor plan images goes beyond a sole pixel-wise visual examination and is crucially about similarities and differences in the shapes and relations between subdivisions that compose the layout. Currently, deep metric learning approaches are used to learn a pair-wise vector representation space that closely mimics the structural similarity, in which the models are trained on similarity labels that are obtained by Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To compensate for the lack of structural awareness in IoU, graph-based approaches such as Graph Matching Networks (GMNs) are used, which require pairwise inference for comparing data instances, making GMNs less practical for retrieval applications. In this paper, an effective evaluation metric for judging the structural similarity of floor plans, coined SSIG (Structural Similarity by IoU and GED), is proposed based on both image and graph distances. In addition, an efficient algorithm is developed that uses SSIG to rank a large-scale floor plan database. Code will be openly available.",No

Using our Graph Neural Network architecture, we can then refine the available information and predict unobserved room properties. In a second step, we introduce a Constrained Diffusion Model to reconstruct consistent floor plan matching the available information, despite of its sparsity. More precisely, we use a Cross-Attention mechanism armed with shape descriptors to guarantee that the generated floor plan reflects both the input room connectivity and the geometry observed in the sparse views.",No

iccvw_2023_168,DeFi: Detection and Filling of Holes in Point Clouds Towards Restoration of Digitized Cultural Heritage Models.,"In this paper, we propose DeFi: a novel perspective for hole detection and filling of a given deteriorated 3D point cloud towards digital preservation of cultural heritage sites. Preservation of heritage demands digitization as cultural heritage sites deteriorate due to natural calamities and human activities. Digital preservation promotes acquisition of 3D data using 3D sensor or Multi-view reconstruction. Unfortunately, 3D data acquisition finds challenges due to the limitations in sensor technology and inappropriate capture conditions, leading to formation of missing regions or holes in the acquired point cloud. To address this, we propose a pipeline consisting of detection of hole boundaries, and understanding the geometry of the hole boundaries to fill the region of the point cloud. Recent research on hole detection and filling fails to generalize on complex structures such as heritage sites, as they find challenges in differentiating between the hole boundary and non-hole boundary points. To address this, we propose to detect boundary points of point cloud and learn to classify them into ""hole boundary"" and ""non-hole boundary"" points. We generate a synthetic dataset based on ModelNet40 to learn the detection of hole boundaries. We demonstrate the results of the proposed pipeline on (i) ModelNet40 dataset, (ii) Heritage 3D models generated via photogrammetry, and compare the results with state-of-the-art methods.",No
iccvw_2023_169,Facsimiles-based deep learning for matching relief-printed decorations on medieval ceramic sherds.,"In this paper, we addressed the problem faced by archaeologists in associating relief-printed decorations on ceramic objects discovered during excavations carried out with the same wheel. This is crucial to understand the trade networks between regions, but highly complex and time-consuming task. We used two approaches: supervised classification or unsupervised clustering of 2D relief views generated from 3D scans of ceramic sherds. Inspired by experimental archaeology, we created wheel facsimiles to supplement significantly the database with numerous plausible and clearly identified samples. Taking advantage of the powerful convolutional neural network EfficientNet to extract reliable discriminating features, experimental results show that the facsimiles significantly improve the networksâ€™ training to achieve a classification accuracy exceeding 95% on real sherds. On the other hand, unsupervised spectral clustering from a vector reduced to a few hundred of the most significant features delivered by the network EfficientNet-B5 trained on ImageNet, without any fine-tuning, achieves an accuracy of 77.47% on our database. These results validate the strategy of using facsimiles to supplement a too-small data set and are very promising for the development of a computer-assisted archaeology tool for pattern-wheel association.",No

In this paper, we propose an approach for improving the list of similar paintings according to specific simulated criteria. By this approach, we retrieve paintings similar to a request image using ResNet50 model and ANNOY algorithm. Then, we simulate re-ranking based on the two criteria, and use the re-ranked lists for training LambdaMART model. Finally, we demonstrate that the trained model reproduces the re-ranking for the query painting by the specific criteria. We plan to use the proposed approach for reproducing re-rankings made by art history specialists, when this data will be collected.",No

iccvw_2023_172,Evaluation of 3D Reconstruction for Cultural Heritage Applications.,"In recent years, we have seen the emergence of methods for creating 3D digital reproductions of objects using photos. These techniques, particularly when combined with handheld video devices like smartphones, have significant applications in various fields such as medicine, museology, mechanics, and archaeology. However, previous works often lack an objective assessment of the resulting modelsâ€™ quality. To address this issue, the paper focuses on the systematic evaluation of reconstruction methods. This paper investigates the principles and application of the Chamfer distance, specifically the average, forward, and backward variants, for evaluating reconstructions produced by different methods: Photogrammetry, NeRF, and NVDiffrec. We also explore the impact of background filtering on the reconstructions. The ground truth for comparison is a reconstruction obtained with a structured light scanner, considered the best possible reconstruction with current technology.

iccvw_2023_174,Hyperspectral Imaging of In-Site Stained Glasses: Illumination Variation Compensation Using Two Perpendicular Scans.,"This paper presents a method for compensating temporal illumination variations in whisk-broom hyperspectral imaging. Whisk-broom imaging scans the scene sequentially, capturing a complete spectrum at each spatial coordinate pixel-by-pixel over time. The scanning process takes time, which is not problematic under constant illumination, but capturing cultural artefacts on-site often involves sunlight as the natural illumination source. While it may be considered beneficial due to its broad spectrum, sunlight fluctuates over time. Thus the resulting hyperspectral image suffers from temporal illumination variation, affecting the observed value and hindering scene analysis. A previous approach proposed using a quick extra single-vertical scan alongside the standard raster (horizontal) scan for compensation. However, it fails when the additional single-vertical scan is performed near or on a black frame. This work aims to overcome this issue by incorporating multiple columns or a full-vertical scan (column scan) to the horizontal scan image (row scan). Furthermore, we introduce a logarithm space and utilise the low-dimensional structures of the illumination and reflectance spectra. Experiments show that the proposed method eliminates the temporal illumination variations in the in-site captured hyperspectral images of stained-glass windows in the historic Amiens Cathedral, France.",No
iccvw_2023_175,Pigment Mapping for Tomb Murals using Neural Representation and Physics-based Model.,"This paper presents a pigment mapping in tomb murals for digitization. In order to separate pigments from their substrates, we utilize the Kubelka-Munk (KM) model. However, these murals are drawn on rocks, and the pigments have deteriorated and thinned over time. As such, the challenge is to cancel the impact of the rocksâ€™ heterogeneous patterns; previous studies using the KM model either ignored the substrate or assumed it to be constant. We introduce unsupervised learning based on neural representations and physics to facilitate pigment mapping, even on a heterogeneous substrate. The model takes an image of the spectral reflectance data at a specific position of a tomb mural image and the corresponding position as inputs and outputs the pigment thickness, pigment class, and substrate class. For physically-consistent estimation, the input reflectance is reconstructed using the Kubelka-Munk model and the output. This allows unsupervised training via the calculation of the reconstruction loss. While the Kubelka-Munk model operates on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the utilization of neural representation by the input position facilitates highly accurate estimation, all the while maintaining spatial continuity.",No

We created and used the HeiCuBeDa and MaiCuBeDa datasets, which consist of around 500 annotated tablets. For our novel OCR-like approach to mixed image data, we provide an additional mapping tool for transferring annotations between 3D renderings and photographs. Our sign localization uses a RepPoints detector to predict the locations of characters as bounding boxes. We use image data from GigaMeshâ€™s MSII (curvature) based rendering, Phong-shaded 3D models, and photographs as well as illumination augmentation. The results show that using rendered 3D images for sign detection performs better than other work on photographs.

iccvw_2023_179,Diffusion Based Augmentation for Captioning and Retrieval in Cultural Heritage.,"Cultural heritage applications and advanced machine learning models are creating a fruitful synergy to provide effective and accessible ways of interacting with artworks. Smart audio-guides, personalized art-related content and gamification approaches are just a few examples of how technology can be exploited to provide additional value to artists or exhibitions. Nonetheless, from a machine learning point of view, the amount of available artistic data is often not enough to train effective models. Off-the-shelf computer vision modules can still be exploited to some extent, yet a severe domain shift is present between art images and standard natural image datasets used to train such models. As a result, this can lead to degraded performance. This paper introduces a novel approach to address the challenges of limited annotated data and domain shifts in the cultural heritage domain. By leveraging generative vision-language models, we augment art datasets by generating diverse variations of artworks conditioned on their captions. This augmentation strategy enhances dataset diversity, bridging the gap between natural images and artworks, and improving the alignment of visual cues with knowledge from general-purpose datasets. The generated variations assist in training vision and language models with a deeper understanding of artistic characteristics and that are able to generate better captions with appropriate jargon.",No

In this paper, we introduce an innovative framework for the reconstruction of individual 3D building CAD models derived from point clouds generated by UAV-captured photographs. Our framework encompasses four pivotal components: An instance segmentation model designed to extract buildings from UAV-observed point clouds. Estimation of building surfaces through the utilization of neural networks and the signed distance function of point clouds. Edge estimation based on the inferred building surface. Estimation of building polygons derived from the identified edges. Experimental results obtained from the SPLAT3D dataset affirm the capability of our proposed methodology to generate high-quality building models, thereby offering substantial advantages in terms of accuracy, compactness, and computational efficiency.

iccvw_2023_184,APNet: Urban-level Scene Segmentation of Aerial Images and Point Clouds.,"In this paper, we focus on semantic segmentation method for point clouds of urban scenes. Our fundamental concept revolves around the collaborative utilization of diverse scene representations to benefit from different context information and network architectures. To this end, the proposed network architecture, called APNet, is split into two branches: a point cloud branch and an aerial image branch which input is generated from a point cloud. To leverage the different properties of each branch, we employ a geometry-aware fusion module that is learned to combine the results of each branch. Additional separate losses for each branch avoid that one branch dominates the results, ensure the best performance for each branch individually and explicitly define the input domain of the fusion network assuring it only performs data fusion. Our experiments demonstrate that the fusion output consistently outperforms the individual network branches and that APNet achieves state-of-the-art performance of 65.2 mIoU on the SensatUrban dataset. Upon acceptance, the source code will be made accessible.",No
iccvw_2023_185,Rotation-invariant Hierarchical Segmentation on PoincarÃ© Ball for 3D Point Cloud.,"Point clouds are a set of data points in space to represent the 3D geometry of objects. A fundamental step in the processing is to achieve segmentation of the point cloud at different levels of detail. Within this context, hierarchical clustering (HC) breaks the point cloud down into coherent subsets to recognize the parts that make up the object. Along with classic approaches that build a hierarchical tree bottom-up using linkage criteria, recent developments exploit the tree-likeness of hyperbolic metric space, embedding data into the PoincarÃ© Ball and capturing a hierarchical structure with low distortion. The main advantage of this kind of solution is the possibility to explore the space of discrete binary trees using continuous optimization. However, in this framework, a similarity function between points is assumed to be known, while this cannot always be granted for point cloud applications. In our method, we propose to use metric learning to fit at the same time the good similarity function and the optimal embedding into the hyperbolic space. Furthermore, when arbitrary rotations are applied to a 3D object, the pose should not influence the segmentation quality. Therefore, to avoid extensive data augmentation, we impose rotation invariance to ensure the uniqueness of the hierarchical segmentation of point clouds. We show the performance of our method on two datasets, ShapeNet and PartNet, at different levels of granularity. The results obtained are promising when compared to state-of-the-art flat segmentation. 1",No
iccvw_2023_186,Fine-Tuned but Zero-Shot 3D Shape Sketch View Similarity and Retrieval.,"Recently, encoders like ViT (vision transformer) and ResNet have been trained on vast datasets and utilized as perceptual metrics for comparing sketches and images, as well as multi-domain encoders in a zero-shot setting. However, there has been limited effort to quantify the granularity of these encoders. Our work addresses this gap by focusing on multi-modal 2D projections of individual 3D instances. This task holds crucial implications for retrieval and sketch-based modeling. We show that in a zero-shot setting (without retraining on a specific shape category or sketch style), the more abstract the sketch, the higher the likelihood of incorrect image matches. Even within the same sketch domain, sketches of the same object drawn in different styles, for example by distinct individuals, might not be accurately matched. One of the key findings of our research is that meticulous fine-tuning on one class of 3D shapes leads to improved performance on other shape classes (fine-tuned but zero-shot), reaching or surpassing the accuracy of supervised methods. We compare and discuss several fine-tuning strategies. Additionally, we delve deeply into how the scale of an object in a sketch influences the similarity of features at different network layers, helping us identify which network layers provide the most accurate matching. Significantly, we discover that ViT and ResNet perform best when dealing with similar object scales. We believe that our work will have a significant impact on research in the sketch domain, providing insights and guidance on how to adopt large pre-trained models as perceptual losses.

In this paper, we propose MinD, the first VIP OLCFPP scheme that notifies the VIP of the shortest path required to avoid Critical Moving Objects (CMOs), like cars, motorcycles, etc. This simultaneously accounts for the VIPâ€™s mobility constraints, the different CMO types and movement patterns, and predicted collision times, conducting a safety prediction trajectory analysis of the optimal path for the VIP to move in. We implement a real-world prototype to conduct extensive outdoor experiments that record the aforementioned parameters, and this populates our simulations for evaluation against the state-of-the-art. Experimental results demonstrate that MinD outperforms the Artificial Potential Field (APF) approach in effectively planning a short collision-free route, requiring only 1.69m of movement on average, shorter than APF by 90.23%, with a 0% collision rate; adapting to the VIPâ€™s mobility limitations and provides a high safe time separation (> 5.35s on average compared to APF).

This paper introduces a method for determining the robot's search strategy through the observation of human search behavior and engaging in dialog with the human. The behavior is determined by comparing estimated travel times for different behaviors with the actual elapsed time. When faced with multiple potential behaviors, the robot selectively generates informative queries to resolve ambiguities and obtain valuable responses.

In this work, we focus on the application of GSR in assisting people with visual impairments (PVI). However, precise localization information of detected objects is often required to navigate their surroundings confidently and make informed decisions. For the first time, we propose an Open Scene Understanding (OpenSU) system that aims to generate pixelwise dense segmentation masks of involved entities instead of bounding boxes. Specifically, we build our OpenSU system on top of GSR by additionally adopting an efficient Segment Anything Model (SAM). Furthermore, to enhance the feature extraction and interaction between the encoder-decoder structure, we construct our OpenSU system using a solid pure transformer backbone to improve the performance of GSR. In order to accelerate the convergence, we replace all the activation functions within the GSR decoders with GELU, thereby reducing the training duration. In quantitative analysis, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SWiG dataset. Moreover, through field testing on dedicated assistive technology datasets and application demonstrations, the proposed OpenSU system can be used to enhance scene understanding and facilitate the independent mobility of people with visual impairments.

In this paper, we propose a scalable, user-friendly, and cost-effective vision-based human action recognition system utilizing machine learning (ML) and 2D cameras. By providing personalized monitoring, our solution aims to address the limitations of traditional rehabilitation methods and support productive home-based healthcare. A key component of our work involves the use of deep learning (DL) method to align time-series exercise data, which ensures accurate analysis and assessment. Additionally, we introduce the concept of a Golden Feature, which plays a critical role in the framework by providing valuable insights into exercise execution and contributing to overall system accuracy. Furthermore, our framework goes beyond predicting exercise scores and focuses on predicting comments for partially successful cases using a multi-label ML model. This allows for a deeper understanding of the clinical reasons behind partial success, such as the patient's physical condition and their execution of the exercise.

iccvw_2023_195,Repetition-aware Image Sequence Sampling for Recognizing Repetitive Human Actions.,"In the field of video-based human action recognition (HAR), standard hand-crafted and deep learning-based approaches are constrained by the computational and memory requirements of their models and the length of the input sequence that can be processed during learning. Sampling techniques employing a windowed or a random clip cropping have been the simplest and most effective ways to cope with limitations on the maximum possible length of the input sequence. However, such designs do not guarantee that the correct ordering of the action steps is captured, or require several learning iterations. In this work we address this problem for the class of repetitive actions. Specifically, given a temporal segmentation of a repetitive action into its repetitive segments, we propose and develop novel approaches for ranking and selecting/sampling segments so as to improve learning in deep models for HAR. We show that by employing the proposed repetition-aware sampling schemes in state-of-the-art deep models for HAR, the action recognition accuracy is increased. The proposed approach is evaluated on existing datasets and on a new dataset that is tailored to the quantitative evaluation of the task at hand. The obtained results reveal how our approach performs in relation to various characteristics of the observed repetitive actions (repetition frequency, their effects on scene objects, etc) and demonstrate the performance improvements.",No
iccvw_2023_196,IFPNet: Integrated Feature Pyramid Network with Fusion Factor for Lane Detection.,"Lane detection is a basic but challenging task in autonomous driving systems. With a combination of high-level and low-level information, early studies of lane detection have achieved promising results in some scenes. However, achieving better performance is still an urgent need for complex and diverse road conditions. We assume that learning and balancing the finer-scale features and global semantics is one of the keys to improving lane detection performance under these road conditions. In this paper, we propose an integrated feature pyramid network with fusion factor (IFPNet) for better hierarchical information learning and balancing, where a novel FPN structure named Integrated Feature Pyramid (IFP) is proposed for better hierarchical information integration. Classification Fusion Factor (CFF) is also utilized for the balance of hierarchical information.

iccvw_2023_197,Affordance segmentation of hand-occluded containers from exocentric images.,"Visual affordance segmentation identifies the surfaces of an object an agent can interact with. Common challenges for the identification of affordances are the variety of the geometry and physical properties of these surfaces as well as occlusions. In this paper, we focus on occlusions of an object that is hand-held by a person manipulating it. To address this challenge, we propose an affordance segmentation model that uses auxiliary branches to process the object and hand regions separately. The proposed model learns affordance features under hand-occlusion by weighting the feature map through hand and object segmentation. To train the model, we annotated the visual affordances of an existing dataset with mixed-reality images of hand-held containers in third-person (exocentric) images. Experiments on both real and mixed-reality images show that our model achieves better affordance segmentation and generalisation than existing models.",No

Constructing such a digital twin requires estimating the precise 3D positions of instances in space, but Bluetooth sensors lack accuracy, and LiDARs are costly when covering wide areas. Therefore, we propose the use of multiple cameras to capture overlapping videos of the space and reconstruct the 3D positions of instances using geometrical methods. We propose a multimodal approach that utilizes not only vision features, but also position features, to detect the same objects in multiple cameras and use Conditional Random Field (CRF) to infer the identicality of objects detected in multiple cameras. The 3D positions of an instance taken from multiple 2D cameras are then geographically estimated. In the evaluation, we demonstrate the effects of CRF and multimodal approach, and achieve comparative performance with the state-of-the-art method.",No
iccvw_2023_199,VLMAH: Visual-Linguistic Modeling of Action History for Effective Action Anticipation.,"Although existing methods for action anticipation have shown considerably improved performance on the predictability of future events in videos, the way they exploit information related to past actions is constrained by time duration and encoding complexity. This paper addresses the task of action anticipation by taking into consideration the history of all executed actions throughout long, procedural activities. A novel approach noted as Visual-Linguistic Modeling of Action History (VLMAH) is proposed that fuses the immediate past in the form of visual features as well as the distant past based on a cost-effective form of linguistic constructs (semantic labels of the nouns, verbs, or actions). Our approach generates accurate near-future action predictions during procedural activities by leveraging information on the long- and short-term past. Extensive experimental evaluation was conducted on three challenging video datasets containing procedural activities, namely the Meccano, the Assembly-101, and the 50Salads. The results confirm that using long-term action history improves action anticipation and enhances the SOTA Top-1 accuracy.",No
iccvw_2023_200,Towards estimation of human intent in assistive robotic teleoperation using kinaesthetic and visual feedback.,"The ability to predict human intent in manipulating in-hand objects is a crucial aspect of developing intelligent robotic systems that can effectively interact with and assist humans in various tasks. Due to the non-standardized nature of interfaces between different robots, it is non-trivial to establish a one-to-one mapping between the instructions provided by the human operator on to the robot, and vice-versa. Additionally, the round trip of information flow in move-and-wait teleoperation strategy for micro-instructions accumulates considerable delays in performing basic tasks, rendering the overall objective ineffective. In this context, predicting the human intent of teleoperation is a prospective strategy to mitigate the effect of such delays. This entails that a possible set of expected action(s) is to be represented ahead of time. In this study, we propose an ML-driven ensemble approach for estimating the goal pose configuration of an object of interest held within the end-effectors of a remotely connected robot using visual and kinematic measurements. We evaluate our proposed system to infer the intended action of a human operator in a real-world robotic setup involving a haptic glove and a dexterous robotic hand, on three different objects. The proposed methodology outperforms a benchmark model in literature utilizing 60 times lesser prediction time with substantially better performance. We provide a comparative analysis of intent prediction strategy using independent visual and kinaesthetic data and discuss its improvement when combining both the modalities.",No
iccvw_2023_201,SHOWMe: Benchmarking Object-agnostic Hand-Object 3D Reconstruction.,"Recent hand-object interaction datasets show limited real object variability and rely on fitting the MANO parametric model to obtain groundtruth hand shapes. To go beyond these limitations and spur further research, we introduce the SHOWMe dataset which consists of 96 videos, annotated with real and detailed hand-object 3D textured meshes. Following recent work, we consider a rigid hand-object scenario, in which the pose of the hand with respect to the object remains constant during the whole video sequence. This assumption allows us to register sub-millimeter-precise groundtruth 3D scans to the image sequences in SHOWMe. Although simpler, this hypothesis makes sense in terms of applications where the required accuracy and level of detail is important e.g., object hand-over in human-robot collaboration, object scanning, or manipulation and contact point analysis. Importantly, the rigidity of the hand-object systems allows to tackle video-based 3D reconstruction of unknown handheld objects using a 2-stage pipeline consisting of a rigid registration step followed by a multi-view reconstruction (MVR) part. We carefully evaluate a set of non-trivial baselines for these two stages and show that it is possible to achieve promising object-agnostic 3D hand-object reconstructions employing an SfM toolbox or a hand pose estimator to recover the rigid transforms, and off-the-shelf MVR algorithms. However, these methods remain sensitive to the initial camera pose estimates which might be imprecise due to lack of textures on the objects or heavy occlusions of the hands, leaving room for improvements in the reconstruction.

Sign languages are visual languages, which require sign embeddings to capture the visual and linguistic semantics of sign.Unlike many common approaches to Sign Recognition, we focus on explicitly creating sign embeddings that bridge the gap between sign language and spoken language. We propose a learning framework to derive LCC (Learnt Contrastive Concept) embeddings for sign language, a weakly supervised contrastive approach to learning sign embeddings. We train a vocabulary of embeddings that are based on the linguistic labels for sign video. Additionally, we develop a conceptual similarity loss which is able to utilise word embeddings from NLP methods to create sign embeddings that have better sign language to spoken language correspondence. These learnt representations allow the model to automatically localise the sign in time.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art keypoint-based sign recognition performance on the WLASL and BOBSL datasets.",No
iccvw_2023_203,Is context all you need? Scaling Neural Sign Language Translation to Large Domains of Discourse.,"Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that aims to generate spoken language sentences from sign language videos, both of which have different grammar and word/gloss order. From a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) perspective, the straightforward way of training translation models is to use sign language phrase-spoken language sentence pairs. However, human interpreters heavily rely on the context to understand the conveyed information, especially for sign language interpretation, where the vocabulary size may be significantly smaller than their spoken language equivalent.Taking direct inspiration from how humans translate, we propose a novel multi-modal transformer architecture that tackles the translation task in a context-aware manner, as a human would. We use the context from previous sequences and confident predictions to disambiguate weaker visual cues. To achieve this we use complementary transformer encoders, namely: (1) A Video Encoder, that captures the low-level video features at the frame-level, (2) A Spotting Encoder, that models the recognized sign glosses in the video, and (3) A Context Encoder, which captures the context of the preceding sign sequences. We combine the information coming from these encoders in a final transformer decoder to generate spoken language translations.We evaluate our approach on the recently published large-scale BOBSL dataset, which contains ~1.2M sequences, and on the SRF dataset, which was part of the WMT-SLT 2022 challenge. We report significant improvements on state-of-the-art translation performance using contextual information, nearly doubling the reported BLEU-4 scores of baseline approaches.",No
iccvw_2023_204,A New Dataset for End-to-End Sign Language Translation: The Greek Elementary School Dataset.,"Automatic Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a research avenue of great societal impact. End-to-End SLT facilitates the interaction of Hard-of-Hearing (HoH) with hearing people, thus improving their social life and opportunities for participation in social life. However, research within this frame of reference is still in its infancy, and current resources are particularly limited. Existing SLT methods are either of low translation ability or are trained and evaluated on datasets of restricted vocabulary and questionable real-world value. A characteristic example is Phoenix2014T benchmark dataset, which only covers weather forecasts in German Sign Language. To address this shortage of resources, we introduce a newly constructed collection of 29653 Greek Sign Language video-translation pairs which is based on the official syllabus of Greek Elementary School.

iccvw_2023_205,Multimodal Error Correction with Natural Language and Pointing Gestures.,"Error correction is crucial in human-computer interaction, as it can provide supervision for incrementally learning artificial intelligence. If a system maps entities like objects or persons with unknown class to inappropriate existing classes, or misrecognizes entities from known classes when there is too high train-test discrepancy, error correction is a natural way for a user to improve the system. Provided an agent with visual perception, if such entity is in the view of the system, pointing gestures can dramatically simplify the error correction. Therefore, we propose a modularized system for multimodal error correction using natural language and pointing gestures. First, pointing line generation and region proposal detects whether there is a pointing gesture, and if yes, which candidate objects (i.e. RoIs) are on the pointing line. Second, these RoIs (if any) and the userâ€™s utterances are fed into a VL-T5 network to extract and link both the class name and the corresponding RoI of the referred entity, or to output that there is no error correction. In the latter case, the utterances can be passed to a downstream component for Natural Language Understanding. We use additional, challenging annotations for an existing real-world pointing gesture dataset to evaluate our proposed system. Furthermore, we demonstrate our approach by integrating it on a real-world steerable laser pointer robot, enabling interactive multimodal error correction and thus incremental learning of new objects.",No

iccvw_2023_208,From Scarcity to Understanding: Transfer Learning for the Extremely Low Resource Irish Sign Language.,"One of the most significant challenges to sign language recognition (SLR) today is the low resource nature of sign language datasets, with many datasets being extremely low resource. Transfer learning is therefore a promising, and likely indispensable, method of increasing recognition performance. The use of pose estimation models, which are typically trained on a large and diverse population, can also aid generalization for extremely low resource sign languages. However, research on transfer learning for pose estimation keypoints as inputs has been limited. In this work, we explore transfer learning as a means to improve SLR classification performance for the extremely low resource Irish Sign Language (ISL). We show that transfer learning on larger datasets containing secondary sign languages significantly improves performance on our target sign language, ISL. To understand these results and the attributes that make one dataset better than another for pre-training, we analyse the linguistic relationships between these datasets. We find that certain attributes of datasets are associated with better transfer learning performance. We hope that our findings will not only motivate further research into transfer learning for pose keypoint-based SLR but also act as a practical guide to researchers on choosing the most suitable datasets with which to pre-train models.",No
iccvw_2023_209,FewFaceNet: A Lightweight Few-Shot Learning-based Incremental Face Authentication for Edge Cameras.,"Face authentication is a widely used technique for verifying identity, but current approaches encounter limitations due to their reliance on extensive computing resources, large datasets, and well-lit environments. Additionally, these approaches often lack adaptability to accommodate new individuals and continuously improve performance. These constraints make them impractical for various edge applications such as smart home security, bio-metric, surveillance system, etc. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel technique called FewFaceNet, which leverages a very lightweight few-shot learning-based incremental face authentication. Unlike existing methods, FewFaceNet employs a shallow lightweight backbone model that can start work with just one face image and also can handle infrared images in dark environments. These features make it highly suitable for deployment on small-edge cameras like door security cameras. We curated a diverse dataset from various reliable sources, including our own infrared camera to train and evaluate the model. Through extensive experimentation, we assessed the performance of FewFaceNet with different backbone ablation studies across one-shot to five-shot scenarios.

iccvw_2023_210,CLIP goes 3D: Leveraging Prompt Tuning for Language Grounded 3D Recognition.,"Vision-Language models like CLIP have been widely adopted for various tasks due to their impressive zero-shot capabilities. However, CLIP is not suitable for extracting 3D geometric features as it was trained on only images and text by natural language supervision. We work on addressing this limitation and propose a new framework termed CG3D (CLIP Goes 3D) where a 3D encoder is learned to exhibit zero-shot capabilities. CG3D is trained using triplets of pointclouds, corresponding rendered 2D images, and texts using natural language supervision. To align the features in a multimodal embedding space, we utilize contrastive loss on 3D features obtained from the 3D encoder, as well as visual and text features extracted from CLIP. We note that the natural images used to train CLIP and the rendered 2D images in CG3D have a distribution shift. Attempting to train the visual and text encoder to account for this shift results in catastrophic forgetting and a notable decrease in performance. To solve this, we employ prompt tuning and introduce trainable parameters in the input space to shift CLIP towards the 3D pre-training dataset utilized in CG3D. We extensively test our pre-trained CG3D framework and demonstrate its impressive capabilities in zero-shot, open scene understanding, and retrieval tasks. Further, it also serves as strong starting weights for fine-tuning in downstream 3D recognition tasks. Code: https://github.com/deeptibhegde/CLIP-goes-3D",No
iccvw_2023_211,Learning to Prompt CLIP for Monocular Depth Estimation: Exploring the Limits of Human Language.,"CLIP is a significant vision-and-language training framework that has shown surprisingly general understanding of the world, with good performance in many openended tasks with little or no additional training. A recent technique has used CLIP to perform 0-shot Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) by using depth-related prompts, but the use of human language in these prompts presents an unnecessary human bias. In this work, we use continuous learnable tokens in place of discrete human-language words to shed light on the problem. We achieve a significant boost in performance, and find that the learned tokens do not map neatly to depth-related human language, implying that CLIPâ€™s concept of depth is not succinctly expressible in human language. We posit that this may extend to other CLIP concepts, and believe that this finding will spark further research into both the use and interpretation of non-linguistic tokens in all open-ended scene interpretation tasks.

iccvw_2023_212,CLIP-FO3D: Learning Free Open-world 3D Scene Representations from 2D Dense CLIP.,"Training a 3D scene understanding model requires complicated human annotations, which are laborious to collect and result in a model only encoding close-set object semantics. In contrast, vision-language pre-training models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable open-world reasoning properties. To this end, we propose directly transferring CLIPâ€™s vision feature space to 3D scene understanding model without any form of supervision. We first modify CLIPâ€™s input and forwarding process so that it can be adapted to extract dense pixel features for 3D scene contents. We then project multi-view image features to the point cloud and train a 3D scene understanding model with feature distillation. Without any annotations or additional training, our model achieves promising annotation-free semantic segmentation results on open-vocabulary semantics and long-tailed concepts. Besides, serving as a cross-modal pre-training framework, our method can be used to improve data efficiency during fine-tuning. Our model outperforms previous SOTA methods in various zero-shot and data-efficient learning benchmarks. Most importantly, our model successfully inherits CLIPâ€™s rich-structured knowledge, allowing 3D scene understanding models to recognize not only object concepts but also open-world semantics.",No
iccvw_2023_213,The Change You Want to See (Now in 3D).,"The goal of this paper is to detect what has changed, if anything, between two ""in the wild"" images of the same 3D scene acquired from different camera positions and at different temporal instances. The open-set nature of this problem, occlusions/dis-occlusions due to the shift in viewpoint, and the lack of suitable training datasets, presents substantial challenges in devising a solution.To address this problem, we contribute a change detection model that is trained entirely on synthetic data and is class-agnostic, yet it is performant out-of-the-box on real world images without requiring fine-tuning. Our solution entails a ""register and difference"" approach that leverages self-supervised frozen embeddings and feature differences, which allows the model to generalise to a wide variety of scenes and domains. The model is able to operate directly on two RGB images, without requiring access to ground truth camera intrinsics, extrinsics, depth maps, point clouds, or additional before-after images. Finally, we collect and release a new evaluation dataset consisting of real-world image pairs with human-annotated differences and demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

iccvw_2023_214,Dynamic Texts From UAV Perspective Natural Images.,"Drone-based image processing offers valuable capabilities for surveillance, detection, and tracking in vast areas, aiding in disaster search and rescue, and monitoring artificial events like traffic jams and outdoor activities under adversarial weather conditions. Nonetheless, this technology encounters numerous challenges, including handling variations in scales and perspectives and coping with environmental factors like sky interference and the presence of far and small objects. Besides, ensuring high visibility distance in 3D depth is crucial for safe flights in various settings, including airports, cities, and fields. However, local weather conditions can change rapidly during flights, leading to visibility issues caused by fog and clouds. Due to the cost of visibility measurement sensors, lower-cost methods using portable apparatus are desired for flight routines. Therefore, this paper proposes a camera-based visibility and weather condition estimation approach using complementary multiple Deep Learning (DL) and Vision Language Models (VLM) under adversarial conditions. Experimental results show the superiority of enhanced 2D/3D captions with physical scales over SOTA VLMs.",No
iccvw_2023_215,SpyroPose: SE(3) Pyramids for Object Pose Distribution Estimation.,"Object pose estimation is an essential computer vision problem in many robot systems. It is usually approached by estimating a single pose with an associated score, however, a score conveys only little information about uncertainty, making it difficult for downstream manipulation tasks to assess risk. In contrast to pose scores, pose distributions could be used in probabilistic frameworks, allowing downstream tasks to make more informed decisions and ultimately increase system reliability. Pose distributions can have arbitrary complexity which motivates unparameterized distributions, however, until now they have been limited to rotation estimation on SO(3) due to the difficulty in training on and normalizing over SE(3). We propose a novel method, SpyroPose, for pose distribution estimation using an SE(3) pyramid: A hierarchical grid with increasing resolution at deeper levels. The pyramid enables efficient training through importance sampling and real time inference by sparse evaluation. SpyroPose is state-of-the-art on SO(3) distribution estimation, and to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first quantitative results on SE(3) distribution estimation. Pose distributions also open new opportunities for sensor-fusion, and we show a simple multi-view extension of SpyroPose. Project page at spyropose.github.io",No
iccvw_2023_216,Diff3DHPE: A Diffusion Model for 3D Human Pose Estimation.,"Accurately estimating 3D human pose (3D HPE) and joint locations using only 2D keypoints is challenging. The noise in the predictions produced by conventional 2D human pose estimators often impeded the accuracy. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based model for 3D pose estimation, named Diff3DHPE, inspired by diffusion modelsâ€™ noise distillation abilities. The proposed model takes a temporal sequence of 2D keypoints as the input of a GNN backbone model to extract the 3D pose from Gaussian noise using a diffusion process during training. The model then refines it using a reverse diffusion process. To overcome over-smoothing issues in GNNs, Diff3DHPE is integrated with a discretized partial differential equation, which makes it a particular form of Graph Neural Diffusion (GRAND). Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, achieving up to 39.1% improvement in MPJPE on MPI-INF-3DHP.

iccvw_2023_217,Revisiting Fully Convolutional Geometric Features for Object 6D Pose Estimation.,"Recent works on 6D object pose estimation focus on learning keypoint correspondences between images and object models, and then determine the object pose through RANSAC-based algorithms or by directly regressing the pose with end-to-end optimisations. We argue that learning point-level discriminative features is overlooked in the literature. To this end, we revisit Fully Convolutional Geometric Features (FCGF) and tailor it for object 6D pose estimation to achieve state-of-the-art performance. FCGF employs sparse convolutions and learns point-level features using a fully-convolutional network by optimising a hardest contrastive loss. We can outperform recent competitors on popular benchmarks by adopting key modifications to the loss and to the input data representations, by carefully tuning the training strategies, and by employing data augmentations suitable for the underlying problem. We carry out a thorough ablation to study the contribution of each modification. The code is available at https://github.com/jcorsetti/FCGF6D.",No
iccvw_2023_218,Accidental Turntables: Learning 3D Pose by Watching Objects Turn.,"We propose a technique for learning single-view 3D object pose estimation models by utilizing a new source of data â€” in-the-wild videos where objects turn. Such videos are prevalent in practice (e.g. cars in roundabouts, airplanes near runways) and easy to collect. We show that classical structure-from-motion algorithms, coupled with the recent advances in instance detection and feature matching, provide surprisingly accurate relative 3D pose estimation on such videos. We propose a multi-stage training scheme that first learns a canonical pose across a collection of videos and then supervises a model for single-view pose estimation. The proposed technique achieves competitive performance with respect to the existing state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks for 3D pose estimation without requiring any pose labels during training. We also contribute an Accidental Turntables Dataset, containing a challenging set of 41,212 images of cars in cluttered backgrounds, motion blur, and illumination changes that serve as a benchmark for 3D pose estimation.",No
iccvw_2023_219,NeRF-Pose: A First-Reconstruct-Then-Regress Approach for Weakly-supervised 6D Object Pose Estimation.,"Pose estimation of 3D objects in monocular images is a fundamental and long-standing problem in computer vision. Existing deep learning approaches for 6D pose estimation typically rely on the availability of 3D object models and 6D pose annotations. However, precise annotation of 6D poses in real data is intricate, time-consuming and not scalable, while synthetic data scales well but lacks realism. To avoid these problems, we present a weakly-supervised reconstruction-based pipeline, named NeRF-Pose, which needs only 2D bounding boxes and relative camera poses during training. Following the first-reconstruct-then-regress idea, we first reconstruct the objects from multiple views in the form of an implicit neural representation. Then, we train a pose regression network to predict pixel-wise 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model. A NeRF-enabled PnP+RANSAC algorithm is used to estimate stable and accurate pose from the predicted correspondences. Experiments on LineMod and LineMod-Occlusion show that the proposed method has state-of-the-art accuracy in comparison to the best 6D pose estimation methods in spite of being trained only with weak labels. We extend the Homebrewed DB dataset with real training images to support the weakly supervised task and achieve compelling results. The extended dataset and code will be released soon.",No
iccvw_2023_220,CNOS: A Strong Baseline for CAD-based Novel Object Segmentation.,"We propose a simple yet powerful method to segment novel objects in RGB images from their CAD models. Leveraging recent foundation models, Segment Anything and DINOv2, we generate segmentation proposals in the input image and match them against object templates that are pre-rendered using the CAD models. The matching is realized by comparing DINOv2 cls tokens of the proposed regions and the templates. The output of the method is a set of segmentation masks associated with per-object confidences defined by the matching scores. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in CAD-based novel object segmentation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge, surpassing the recent method of Chen et al. by absolute 19.8% AP.",No
iccvw_2023_221,Reconstruction of 3D Interaction Models from Images using Shape Prior.,"We investigate the reconstruction of 3D human-object interactions from images, encompassing 3D human shape and pose estimation as well as object shape and pose estimation. To address this task, we introduce an autoregressive transformer-based variational autoencoder capable of learning a robust shape prior from extensive 3D shape datasets. Additionally, we leverage the reconstructed 3D human body as supplementary features for object shape and pose estimation. In contrast, prior methods only predict object pose and rely on shape templates for shape prediction. Experimental findings on the BEHAVE dataset underscore the effectiveness of our proposed approach, achieving a 40.7cm Chamfer distance and demonstrating the advantages of learning a shape prior.",No
iccvw_2023_222,PoseMatcher: One-shot 6D Object Pose Estimation by Deep Feature Matching.,"Estimating the pose of an unseen object is the goal of the challenging one-shot pose estimation task. Previous methods have heavily relied on feature matching with great success. However, these methods are often inefficient and limited by their reliance on pre-trained models that have not be designed specifically for pose estimation. In this paper we propose PoseMatcher, an accurate one-shot object pose estimator that overcomes these limitations. We create a new training pipeline for object to image matching based on a three-view system: a query with a positive and negative templates. This simple yet effective approach emulates test time scenarios by cheaply constructing an approximation of the full object point cloud during training. To enable PoseMatcher to attend to distinct input modalities, an image and a pointcloud, we introduce IO-Layer, a new attention layer that efficiently accommodates self and cross attention between the inputs. Moreover, we propose a pruning strategy where we iteratively remove redundant regions of the target object to further reduce the complexity and noise of the network while maintaining accuracy. Finally we redesign commonly used pose refinement strategies, zoom and 2D offset refinements, and adapt them to the one-shot paradigm. We outperform all prior real-time one-shot pose estimation methods on the Linemod and YCB-V datasets as well achieve results rivaling recent instance-level methods.

iccvw_2023_223,SegDA: Maximum Separable Segment Mask with Pseudo Labels for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation.,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to solve the problem of label scarcity of the target domain by transferring the knowledge from the label rich source domain. Usually, the source domain consists of synthetic images for which the annotation is easily obtained using the well known computer graphics techniques. However, obtaining annotation for real world images (target domain) require lot of manual annotation effort and is very time consuming because it requires per pixel annotation. To address this problem we propose SegDA module to enhance transfer performance of UDA methods by learning the maximum separable segment representation. This resolves the problem of identifying visually similar classes like pedestrian/rider, sidewalk/road etc. We leveraged Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier inspired from Neural Collapse for maximal separation between segment classes. This causes the source domain pixel representation to collapse to a single vector forming a simplex vertices which are aligned to the maximal separable ETF classifier. We use this phenomenon to propose the novel architecture for domain adaptation of segment representation for target domain. Additionally, we proposed to estimate the noise in labelling the target domain images and update the decoder for noise correction which encourages the discovery of pixels for classes not identified in pseudo labels. We have used four UDA benchmarks simulating synthetic-to-real, daytime-to-nighttime, clear-to-adverse weather scenarios. Our proposed approach outperforms +2.2 mIoU on GTA â†’ Cityscapes, +2.0 mIoU on Synthia â†’ Cityscapes, +5.9 mIoU on Cityscapes â†’ DarkZurich, +2.6 mIoU on Cityscapes â†’ ACDC.",No
iccvw_2023_224,Cross-Dimensional Refined Learning for Real-Time 3D Visual Perception from Monocular Video.,"We present a novel real-time capable learning method that jointly perceives a 3D sceneâ€™s geometry structure and semantic labels. Recent approaches to real-time 3D scene reconstruction mostly adopt a volumetric scheme, where a Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) is directly regressed. However, these volumetric approaches tend to focus on the global coherence of their reconstructions, which leads to a lack of local geometric detail. To overcome this issue, we propose to leverage the latent geometric prior knowledge in 2D image features by explicit depth prediction and anchored feature generation, to refine the occupancy learning in TSDF volume. Besides, we find that this cross-dimensional feature refinement methodology can also be adopted for the semantic segmentation task by utilizing semantic priors. Hence, we proposed an end-to-end cross-dimensional refinement neural network (CDRNet) to extract both 3D mesh and 3D semantic labeling in real time. The experiment results show that this method achieves a state-of-the-art 3D perception efficiency on multiple datasets, which indicates the great potential of our method for industrial applications.",No
iccvw_2023_225,A Lightweight Skeleton-Based 3D-CNN for Real-Time Fall Detection and Action Recognition.,"Implementing skeleton-based action recognition in real-world applications is a difficult task, because it involves multiple modules such as person detection and pose estimaton. In terms of context, skeleton-based approach has the strong advantage of robustness in understanding actual human actions. However, for most real-world videos in the standard benchmark datasets, human poses are not easy to detect, (i.e. only partially visible or occluded by other objects), and existing pose estimators mostly fail to detect the person during the falling motion. Thus, we propose a newly augmented human pose dataset to improve the accuracy of pose extraction. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight skeleton-based 3D-CNN action recognition network that shows significant improvement on accuracy and processing time over the baseline. Experimental results show that the proposed skeleton-based method shows high accuracy and efficiency in real world scenarios.",No

Precise prediction of human pose and motion trajectory holds great significance for various applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality. This paper presents a novel approach to address the interconnected tasks of estimating human motion, represented as 3D poses or 2D trajectories, and predicting future motions using 2D images and human pose/position sequences jointly. We propose an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages Transformer networks with a self-attention mechanism, utilizing visual context features, combined with an LSTM to model human motion kinematics. Our approach demonstrates consistent and remarkable improvements over existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse public datasets, such as GTA-IM and PROX for 3D human pose estimation, and ETH and UCY combined datasets for 2D trajectory prediction, showcase that our method substantially reduces prediction errors compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.",No
iccvw_2023_227,THÃ–R-Magni: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Role-conditioned Human Mtion Prediction.,"Autonomous systems, that need to operate in human environments and interact with the users, rely on understanding and anticipating human activity and motion. Among the many factors which influence human motion, semantic attributes, such as the roles and ongoing activities of the detected people, provide a powerful cue on their future motion, actions, and intentions. In this work we adapt several popular deep learning models for trajectory prediction with labels corresponding to the roles of the people. To this end we use the novel THÃ–R-Magni dataset, which captures human activity in industrial settings and includes the relevant semantic labels for people who navigate complex environments, interact with objects and robots, work alone and in groups. In qualitative and quantitative experiments we show that the role-conditioned LSTM, Transformer, GAN and VAE methods can effectively incorporate the semantic categories, better capture the underlying input distribution and therefore produce more accurate motion predictions in terms of Top-K ADE/FDE and log-likelihood metrics.",No

However, the scarcity of large-scale real datasets with pixel-level annotations poses a significant challenge to researchers as the limited number of images in existing datasets hinders the effectiveness of deep learning models that require a large amount of training data. In this paper, we propose a multimodal synthetic dataset containing both images and 3D data taken at multiple flying heights to address these limitations. In addition to object-level annotations, the provided data also include pixel-level labeling in 28 classes, enabling exploration of the potential advantages in tasks like semantic segmentation. In total, our dataset contains 72k labeled samples that allow for effective training of deep architectures showing promising results in synthetic-to-real adaptation. The dataset will be made publicly available to support the development of novel computer vision methods targeting UAV applications.",No

Our experiments show that, in practical use cases, the benefit of adding such planar constraint shows benefits for scene estimation but limited effect in the camera pose estimation.",No
iccvw_2023_230,LightNet: Generative Model for Enhancement of Low-Light Images.,"In this work, we propose a generative model for enhancement of images captured in low-light conditions. Sensor constraints and inappropriate lighting conditions are accountable for degradations introduced in the image. The degradations limit the visibility of the scene and impedes vision in applications like detection, tracking and surveillance. Recently, deep learning algorithms have taken a leap for enhancement of images captured in low-light conditions. However, these algorithms fail to capture information on fine grained local structures and limit the performance. Towards this, we propose a generative model for enhancement of low-lit images to exploit both local and global information, and term it as LightNet. In proposed architecture LightNet, we include a hierarchical generator encompassing encoder-decoder module to capture global information and a patch discriminator to capture fine grained local information. Typically, the encoder-decoder module downsamples the low-lit image into distinct scales. Learning at distinct scales helps to capture both local and global features thereby suppressing the unwanted features (noise, blur). With this motivation, we downsample the captured low-lit image into 3 distinct scales. The decoder upsamples the encoded features at respective scales to generate an enhanced image. We demonstrate the results of proposed methodology on custom and benchmark datasets in comparison with SOTA methods using appropriate quantitative metrics.",No
iccvw_2023_231,Domain Adversarial Learning Towards Underwater Image Enhancement.,"Underwater images are degraded due to the absorption and scattering of light inside the water. The underwater degradation causes the loss of information in terms of texture, style, color, and minute detail of edges and hence the degraded images are not useful in many higher-order applications. Several deep learning techniques are explored by researchers across the globe for the same. Further, deep learning networks learn the distribution of degraded training samples and fail when there is a deviation due to a change in water type. This paper proposes an encoder-decoder network that preserves the image content, texture, and style while maintaining overall global similarity by capturing the inherent distribution of the training samples. To overcome the deviation due to a change in water type, a classifier network is induced in the latent space of encoder-decoder architecture. The classifier loss and adversarial loss in the classifier network ensure the learning across domains and avoid setting priors on captured distribution. Hence, the proposed model is robust against the change of water type and can be deployed in real-life without retraining. To train the model, we use attenuation coefficients of underwater environments at different depths to recreate 5430 paired underwater images from the Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark (UIEB) dataset with six distinct types of water. Our proposed model enhanced the degraded images among different degradation levels due to depth and water type variations. The proposed model is evaluated on UIEB and EUVP benchmark databases.

To further reduce the transmission size, we propose a novel optimization-based technique to determine a sparse set of key nodes capable of transmitting the transformations efficiently.",No
iccvw_2023_233,Window-based Model Averaging Improves Generalization in Heterogeneous Federated Learning.,"Federated Learning (FL) aims to learn a global model from distributed users while protecting their privacy. However, when data are distributed heterogeneously the learning process becomes noisy, unstable, and biased towards the last seen clientsâ€™ data, slowing down convergence. To address these issues and improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the global model, we propose WiMA (Window-based Model Averaging). WiMA aggregates global models from different rounds using a window-based approach, effectively capturing knowledge from multiple users and reducing the bias from the last ones. By adopting a windowed view on the rounds, WiMA can be applied from the initial stages of training. Importantly, our method introduces no additional communication or client-side computation overhead. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness of WiMA against distribution shifts and bad client sampling, resulting in smoother and more stable learning trends. Additionally, WiMA can be easily integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms. We extensively evaluate our approach on standard FL benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.",No
iccvw_2023_234,TP-NoDe: Topology-aware Progressive Noising and Denoising of Point Clouds towards Upsampling.,"In this paper, we propose TP-NoDe, a novel Topology-aware Progressive Noising and Denoising technique for 3D point cloud upsampling. TP-NoDe revisits the traditional method of upsampling of the point cloud by introducing a novel perspective of adding local topological noise by incorporating a novel algorithm Density-Aware k nearest neighbour (DA-kNN) followed by denoising to map noisy perturbations to the topology of the point cloud. Unlike previous methods, we progressively upsample the point cloud, starting at a 2 Ã— upsampling ratio and advancing to a desired ratio. TP-NoDe generates intermediate upsampling resolutions for free, obviating the need to train different models for varying upsampling ratios. TP-NoDe mitigates the need for task-specific training of upsampling networks for a specific upsampling ratio by reusing a point cloud denoising framework.

iccvw_2023_235,Mirror U-Net: Marrying Multimodal Fission with Multi-task Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Medical Imaging.,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) are routinely used together to detect tumors. PET/CT segmentation models can automate tumor delineation, however, current multimodal models do not fully exploit the complementary information in each modality, as they either concatenate PET and CT data or fuse them at the decision level. To combat this, we propose Mirror U-Net, which replaces traditional fusion methods with multimodal fission by factorizing the multimodal representation into modality-specific decoder branches and an auxiliary multimodal decoder. At these branches, Mirror U-Net assigns a task tailored to each modality to reinforce unimodal features while preserving multimodal features in the shared representation. In contrast to previous methods that use either fission or multi-task learning, Mirror U-Net combines both paradigms in a unified framework. We explore various task combinations and examine which parameters to share in the model. We evaluate Mirror U-Net on the AutoPET PET/CT and on the multimodal MSD BrainTumor datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in multimodal segmentation and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.

Our method exploits the biological biases of the problem by directly supervising relative differences with respect to mean expression, and leverages local visual context at every coordinate to make predictions using a graph neural network. This approach closes the gap between complete locality and complete globality in current methods. In addition, we propose a novel benchmark that aims to better define the task by following current best practices in transcriptomics and restricting the prediction variables to only those with clear spatial patterns. Our extensive evaluation in two different human breast cancer datasets indicates that SEPAL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and other mechanisms of including spatial context.",No
iccvw_2023_237,Transformers Pay Attention to Convolutions Leveraging Emerging Properties of ViTs by Dual Attention-Image Network.,"Although purely transformer-based architectures pretrained on large datasets are introduced as foundation models for general computer vision tasks, hybrid models that incorporate combinations of convolution and transformer blocks showed state-of-the-art performance in more specialized tasks. Nevertheless, despite the performance gain of both pure and hybrid transformer-based architectures compared to convolutional networks, their high training cost and complexity make it challenging to use them in real scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple architecture based on only convolutional layers and show that by just taking advantage of the attention map visualizations obtained from a self-supervised pretrained vision transformer network, complex transformer-based networks, and even 3D architectures are outperformed with much fewer computation costs. The proposed architecture is composed of two encoder branches with the original image as input in one branch and the attention map visualizations of the same image from multiple self-attention heads from a pre-trained DINO model in the other branch. The results of our experiments on medical imaging datasets show that the extracted attention map visualizations from the attention heads of a pre-trained transformer architecture combined with the image provide strong prior knowledge for a pure CNN architecture to outperform CNN-based and transformer-based architectures.

Rapid detection of lung cancer could reduce the mortality rate and increase the patientâ€™s survival rate, in which tumor segmentation plays a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Nevertheless, manual segmentation by radiologists can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved good results in medical image segmentation. In this paper, RRcUNet 3D, a variant of the Unet model, was proposed to perform tumor segmentation in Computed Tomography (CT) images of NSCLC patients. This network was trained end-to-end from a small set of CT scans of NSCLC patients, then the trained model was validated on another set of CT scans of NSCLC patients.

However, this task is time-consuming and expensive as it requires a detailed visual inspection and interpretation by a trained clinician. In the past decade, several machine learning (ML) methods have been developed to remedy this issue as clinical decision support methods. However, most of these algorithms face challenges like computational feasibility, reliability, and interoperability.In this paper, we develop a unique feature extraction method for chest X-rays by applying the latest topological data analysis (TDA) methods. We observe that normal and abnormal images produce very distinct topological patterns for pneumonia and tuberculosis. By using cubical persistence, we capture these patterns and convert them into powerful feature vectors. By combining with standard ML methods, we obtain a computationally feasible and interpretable model. In our extensive experiments, our model Topo-CXR outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models in several benchmark datasets. Unlike most DL models, our proposed Topo-CXR model does not need any data augmentation or pre-processing steps and works perfectly on small datasets. Furthermore, our topological feature vectors can be easily integrated with any future ML and DL models to boost their performance and improve robustness.",No
iccvw_2023_240,Contrastive Image Synthesis and Self-supervised Feature Adaptation for Cross-Modality Biomedical Image Segmentation.,"This work presents a novel framework CISFA (Contrastive Image synthesis and Self-supervised Feature Adaptation) that builds on image domain translation and unsupervised feature adaptation for cross-modality biomedical image segmentation. Different from existing approaches, our method employs a one-sided generative model and incorporates a weighted patch-wise contrastive loss between sampled patches of the input image and the corresponding synthetic image, which serves as shape constraints. Furthermore, we notice that the generated images and input images share similar structural information but are in different modalities. To address this, we enforce contrastive losses on the generated images and the input images to train the encoder of a segmentation model to minimize the discrepancy between paired images in the learned embedding space. Compared with existing works that rely on adversarial learning for feature adaptation, such a method enables the encoder to learn domain-independent features in a more explicit way. We extensively evaluate our methods on segmentation tasks containing CT and MRI images for abdominal cavities and whole hearts.

While supervised deep learning-based methods have been successful in numerous segmentation tasks, they rely on a large number of labeled images for training, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Although unsupervised learning shows potential in addressing this challenge, the performance of current unsupervised algorithms is mostly unsatisfactory. To overcome this issue, we propose a new unsupervised framework for medical lesion segmentation using a novel cross-granularity contrastive (CGC) module. Our module contains coarse-grained and fine-grained discrimination paths that enable the network to capture the distinctions between lesions and normal tissues at different levels of context. We evaluate our method on two large public datasets of CT/MRI scans and demonstrate that our approach improves a Gaussian mixture model-based segmentation by up to 9%, which surpasses all other unsupervised segmentation methods by a large margin. Additionally, our module can also be integrated with other existing unsupervised segmentation methods to further enhance their performance. Therefore, our framework shows great potential for use in medical image applications with limited labeled data availability. The code of this work will be released via https://github.com/yu02019.",No
iccvw_2023_242,Semi-supervised Quality Evaluation of Colonoscopy Procedures.,"Colonoscopy is the standard of care technique for detecting and removing polyps for the prevention of colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, gastroenterologists (GI) routinely miss approximately 25% of polyps during colonoscopies. These misses are highly operator dependent, influenced by the physician skills, experience, vigilance, and fatigue. Standard quality metrics, such as Withdrawal Time or Cecal Intubation Rate, have been shown to be well correlated with Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR). However, those metrics are limited in their ability to assess the quality of a specific procedure, and they do not address quality aspects related to the style or technique of the examination. In this work we design novel online and offline quality metrics, based on visual appearance quality criteria learned by an ML model in an unsupervised way. Furthermore, we evaluate the likelihood of detecting an existing polyp as a function of procedure quality and use it to demonstrate high correlation of the proposed metric to polyp detection sensitivity. The proposed online quality metric can be used to provide real time quality feedback to the performing GI. By integrating the local metric over the withdrawal phase, we build a global, offline quality metric, which is shown to be highly correlated to the standard Polyp Per Colonoscopy (PPC) quality metric.",No
iccvw_2023_243,Ensuring a connected structure for Retinal Vessels Deep-Learning Segmentation.,"Retinal vessels identification plays a critical role in computer-aided diagnosis and analysis of fundus images. While Deep-Learning-based segmentation methods have shown remarkable performances in handling detailed and pathological fundus, they produce disconnected components whereas retinal vessels are a connected structure. In this work, we developed a post-processing pipeline to ensure a connected structure for the retinal vessels networks. The proposed pipeline named VNR for Vessels Network Retrieval, generates segmentations with a single connected component (CC). This is performed by removing artifacts that are pixels-miss-classified as retinal vessels, and by reconnecting branches that are well-classified but disconnected. By retrieving the structural coherence in the retinal vessels networks, we enable measurements such as vessels length, tortuosity and depth of the vessels tree structure in a more reliable manner. We evaluate our results using pixel-wise and structural metrics, comparing against manually labelled groundtruth. Before applying VNR the predicted segmentations had an average Dice score of 0.839 with 174 CCs. As a result, 173 CCs need to be deleted or reconnected. After applying VNR, the segmentations have an average Dice score of 0.840 with only 1 CC. VNR is thus able to retrieve the connected structure of the retinal vessels networks while also keeping or increasing pixel information.",No
iccvw_2023_244,CLIPath: Fine-tune CLIP with Visual Feature Fusion for Pathology Image Analysis Towards Minimizing Data Collection Efforts.,"Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown its ability to learn distinctive visual representations and generalize to various downstream vision tasks. However, its applicability in the classification of pathology images with limited labeled data is still under study due to the giant domain shift (between large natural image datasets in the source domain and small-scale target pathology images) and overfitting issues. In this work, we first explore the zero-shot transferability of CLIP on pathology classification tasks and benchmark the performance. Then, we propose Residual Feature Connection (RFC) to fine-tune CLIP with a small amount of trainable parameters. RFC aims to fuse the task-specific knowledge learned from the target domain and the original knowledge pre-trained from CLIP. We show that RFC can adapt pre-trained CLIP to downstream pathology tasks and achieve good performance with just a few annotated samples. Specifically, RFC achieves over 19% improvement in accuracy when only using 0.1% of labeled data in PCam with only 10 minutes of fine-tuning while running on a single GPU.",No
iccvw_2023_245,Implicit Neural Representation in Medical Imaging: A Comparative Survey.,"Implicit neural representations (INRs) have gained prominence as a powerful paradigm in scene reconstruction and computer graphics, demonstrating remarkable results. By utilizing neural networks to parameterize data through implicit continuous functions, INRs offer several benefits. Recognizing the potential of INRs beyond these domains, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of INR models in the field of medical imaging. In medical settings, numerous challenging and ill-posed problems exist, making INRs an attractive solution. The survey explores the application of INRs in various medical imaging tasks, such as image reconstruction, segmentation, registration, novel view synthesis, and compression. It discusses the advantages and limitations of INRs, highlighting their resolution-agnostic nature, memory efficiency, ability to avoid locality biases, and differentiability, enabling adaptation to different tasks. Furthermore, the survey addresses the challenges and considerations specific to medical imaging data, such as data availability, computational complexity, and dynamic clinical scene analysis. It also identifies future research directions and opportunities, including integration with multi-modal imaging, real-time and interactive systems, and domain adaptation for clinical decision support.

iccvw_2023_246,HyperCoil-Recon: A Hypernetwork-based Adaptive Coil Configuration Task Switching Network for MRI Reconstruction.,"Parallel imaging, a fast MRI technique, involves dynamic adjustments based on the configuration i.e. number, positioning, and sensitivity of the coils with respect to the anatomy under study. Conventional deep learning-based image reconstruction models have to be trained or fine-tuned for each configuration, posing a barrier to clinical translation, given the lack of computational resources and machine learning expertise for clinicians to train models at deployment. Joint training on diverse datasets learns a single weight set that might underfit to deviated configurations. We propose, HyperCoil-Recon, a hypernetwork-based coil configuration task-switching network for multi-coil MRI reconstruction that encodes varying configurations of the numbers of coils in a multi-tasking perspective, posing each configuration as a task. The hypernetworks infer and embed task-specific weights into the reconstruction network, 1) effectively utilizing the contextual knowledge of common and varying image features among the various fields-of-view of the coils, and 2) enabling generality to unseen configurations at test time. Experiments reveal that our approach 1) adapts on the fly to various unseen configurations up to 32 coils when trained on lower numbers (i.e. 7 to 11) of randomly varying coils, and to 120 deviated unseen configurations when trained on 18 configurations in a single model, 2) matches the performance of coil configuration-specific models, and 3) outperforms configuration-invariant models with improvement margins of âˆ¼ 1 dB / 0.03 and 0.3 dB / 0.02 in PSNR / SSIM for knee and brain data.

iccvw_2023_247,Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection from Anomalous Training Data via Iterative Latent Token Masking.,"Anomaly detection and segmentation pose an important task across sectors ranging from medical imaging analysis to industry quality control. However, current unsupervised approaches require training data to not contain any anomalies, a requirement that can be especially challenging in many medical imaging scenarios. In this paper, we propose Iterative Latent Token Masking, a self-supervised framework derived from a robust statistics point of view, translating an iterative model fitting with M-estimators to the task of anomaly detection. In doing so, this allows the training of unsupervised methods on datasets heavily contaminated with anomalous images. Our method stems from prior work on using Transformers, combined with a Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder, for anomaly detection, a method with state-of-the-art performance when trained on normal (non-anomalous) data. More importantly, we utilise the token masking capabilities of Transformers to filter out suspected anomalous tokens from each sampleâ€™s sequence in the training set in an iterative self-supervised process, thus overcoming the difficulties of highly anomalous training data. Our work also highlights shortfalls in current state-of-the-art self-supervised, self-trained and unsupervised models when faced with small proportions of anomalous training data. We evaluate our method on whole-body PET data in addition to showing its wider application in more common computer vision tasks such as the industrial MVTec Dataset. Using varying levels of anomalous training data, our method showcases a superior performance over several state-of-the-art models, drawing attention to the potential of this approach.",No
iccvw_2023_248,Robust AMD Stage Grading with Exclusively OCTA Modality Leveraging 3D Volume.,"Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative eye disease that causes central vision loss. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is an emerging imaging modality that aids in the diagnosis of AMD by displaying the pathogenic vessels in the subretinal space. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of OCTA from the view of deep classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that solely uses OCTA for AMD stage grading. By developing a 2D classifier based on OCTA projections, we identify that segmentation errors in retinal layers significantly affect the accuracy of classification. To address this issue, we propose analyzing 3D OCTA volumes directly using a 2D convolutional neural network trained with additional projection supervision. Our experimental results show that we achieve over 80% accuracy on a four-stage grading task on both error-free and error-prone test sets, which is significantly higher than 60%, the accuracy of human experts. This demonstrates that OCTA provides sufficient information for AMD stage grading and the proposed 3D volume analyzer is more robust when dealing with OCTA data with segmentation errors.",No
iccvw_2023_249,Segmentation-based Assessment of Tumor-Vessel Involvement for Surgical Resectability Prediction of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with limited treatment options. This research proposes a workflow and deep learning-based segmentation models to automatically assess tumor-vessel involvement, a key factor in determining tumor resectability. Correct assessment of resectability is vital to determine treatment options. The proposed workflow involves processing CT scans to segment the tumor and vascular structures, analyzing spatial relationships and the extent of vascular involvement, which follows a similar way of working as expert radiologists in PDAC assessment. Three segmentation architectures (nnU-Net, 3D U-Net, and Probabilistic 3D U-Net) achieve a high accuracy in segmenting veins, arteries, and the tumor. The segmentations enable automated detection of tumor involvement with high accuracy (0.88 sensitivity and 0.86 specificity) and automated computation of the degree of tumor-vessel contact. Additionally, due to significant inter-observer variability in these important structures, we present the uncertainty captured by each of the models to further increase insights into the predicted involvement. This result provides clinicians with a clear indication of tumor-vessel involvement and may be used to facilitate more informed decision-making for surgical interventions. The proposed method offers a valuable tool for improving patient outcomes, personalized treatment strategies and survival rates in pancreatic cancer.",No
iccvw_2023_250,Sharing is Caring: Concurrent Interactive Segmentation and Model Training using a Joint Model.,"The performance of neural predictors depends on the size and composition of the training dataset. However, annotating data is expensive. Efficient annotation systems usually feature a neural annotation predictor whose result can be edited by the expert using classical tools. Existing systems train the annotation predictor from an initial small subset of data annotated by classical tools and then freeze it for the rest of the annotation process. This is suboptimal as the annotation predictor does not benefit from the new annotations as the annotation process progresses. We propose a framework called Single Active Interactive Model (SAIM), which integrates the three steps of data selection, annotation and training into a single architecture. This is made possible by three key properties of SAIM in contrast with existing work: 1) SAIM uses a deep interactive predictor; hence the classical tools are not required and the annotation predictor can be pre-trained with limited data to produce quality annotations; 2) SAIM uses a single model shared between the three steps, hence the model is deployable and the annotation predictor improves as annotation progresses; 3) SAIM uses active learning to maximise the impact of each annotation on the predictor performance, making the model rapidly improve. We evaluated SAIM by emulating annotation scenarios on fully-labelled segmentation datasets. For a complex female pelvis MRI dataset, pre-training SAIM on 15% of data and annotating the whole dataset achieves 73.4% IoU with 6.3 hours of annotation time, against 75.8% IoU for complete manual annotation, requiring 40.0 hours. We also applied SAIM to a real-world case of very large MRI dataset (AMOS) segmentation, which cannot be feasibly annotated otherwise.",No
iccvw_2023_251,Robust MSFM Learning Network for Classification and Weakly Supervised Localization.,"Robust classification and localization of bone fractures are beneficial to avoid misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. However, state-of-the-art classification methods aim to improve accuracy which lacks reliability, and tackled localization problems in a supervised manner with much-annotated data that leads to high costs. In this paper, we propose a multistage feature map (MSFM) learning network to predict the class of the image and the area of interest without annotated bounded box. MSFM consists of three stages to predict the representation with different objectives and aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of classification. The weakly supervised MSFM model localizes the region of interest (ROI) by taking representation from all the stages supervised by image-level labels only. We also introduced a feature augmentation technique to enforce the model to consider other discriminative regions. End-to-end training of MSFM is performed jointly at all stages. Based on the comprehensive experiments, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard MURA dataset, which includes the elbow, finger, forearm, humerus, shoulder, wrist, hand, and bone tumor dataset.

iccvw_2023_252,DISGAN: Wavelet-informed Discriminator Guides GAN to MRI Super-resolution with Noise Cleaning.,"MRI super-resolution (SR) and denoising tasks are fundamental challenges in the field of deep learning, which have traditionally been treated as distinct tasks with separate paired training data. In this paper, we propose an innovative method that addresses both tasks simultaneously using a single deep learning model, eliminating the need for explicitly paired noisy and clean images during training. Our proposed model is primarily trained for SR, but also exhibits remarkable noise-cleaning capabilities in the super-resolved images. Instead of conventional approaches that introduce frequency-related operations into the generative process, our novel approach involves the use of a GAN model guided by a frequency-informed discriminator. To achieve this, we harness the power of the 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) operation as a frequency constraint within the GAN framework for the SR task on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Specifically, our contributions include: 1) a 3D generator based on residual-in-residual connected blocks; 2) the integration of the 3D DWT with 1 Ã— 1 convolution into a DWT+conv unit within a 3D Unet for the discriminator; 3) the use of the trained model for high-quality image SR, accompanied by an intrinsic denoising process. We dub the model ""Denoising Induced Super-resolution GAN (DISGAN)"" due to its dual effects of SR image generation and simultaneous denoising. Departing from the traditional approach of training SR and denoising tasks as separate models, our proposed DISGAN is trained only on the SR task, but also achieves exceptional performance in denoising. The model is trained on 3D MRI data from dozens of subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and further evaluated on previously unseen MRI data from subjects with brain tumours and epilepsy to assess its denoising and SR performance.

iccvw_2023_253,Studying the Impact of Augmentations on Medical Confidence Calibration.,"The clinical explainability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) heavily relies on the joint interpretation of a modelâ€™s predicted diagnostic label and associated confidence. A highly certain or uncertain model can significantly impact clinical decision-making. Thus, ensuring that confidence estimates reflect the true correctness likelihood for a prediction is essential. CNNs are often poorly calibrated and prone to overconfidence leading to improper measures of uncertainty. This creates the need for confidence calibration. However, accuracy and performance-based evaluations of CNNs are commonly used as the sole benchmark for medical tasks. Taking into consideration the risks associated with miscalibration is of high importance. In recent years, modern augmentation techniques, which cut, mix, and combine images, have been introduced. Such augmentations have benefited CNNs through regularization, robustness to adversarial samples, and calibration. Standard augmentations based on image scaling, rotating, and zooming, are widely leveraged in the medical domain to combat the scarcity of data. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of three modern augmentation techniques, CutMix, MixUp, and CutOut on the calibration and performance of CNNs for medical tasks. CutMix improved calibration the most while CutOut often lowered the level of calibration.",No
iccvw_2023_254,Multimodal Contrastive Learning and Tabular Attention for Automated Alzheimer's Disease Prediction.,"Alongside neuroimaging such as MRI scans and PET, Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) datasets contain valuable tabular data including AD biomarkers and clinical assessments. Existing computer vision approaches struggle to utilize this additional information. To address these needs, we propose a generalizable framework for multimodal contrastive learning of image data and tabular data, a novel tabular attention module for amplifying and ranking salient features in tables, and the application of these techniques onto Alzheimerâ€™s disease prediction. Experimental evaulations demonstrate the strength of our framework by detecting Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) from over 882 MR image slices from the ADNI database. We take advantage of the high interpretability of tabular data and our novel tabular attention approach and through attribution of the attention scores for each row of the table, we note and rank the most predominant features. Results show that the model is capable of an accuracy of over 83.8%, almost a 10% increase from previous state of the art.",No
iccvw_2023_255,Weakly Semi-supervised Detector-based Video Classification with Temporal Context for Lung Ultrasound.,"For many challenging medical imaging tasks involving sequences, video-level labels alone are insufficient to train accurate disease classification models and do not carry information about the locations of relevant features. Alternatively, localization-based models such as detectors offer much stronger interpretability by indicating areas of suspicion, but require comprehensive frame-by-frame annotations by experts. We propose a method to address the trade-off between annotation burden and interpretability by performing simultaneous detection and classification on medical video sequences while requiring very limited frame-level supervision. Specifically, our approach aggregates individual predictions from a detection model into ""tracklets"" representing temporally consistent regions of pathology along the sequence. The tracklets are classified in a second stage to arrive at an overall video-level prediction. Both the detector and tracklet classifier are trained in a weakly semi-supervised manner using a large amount of video-annotated data alongside a limited set of frame annotations. We apply the approach to several challenging medical imaging tasks, namely localizing and predicting the presence or absence of lung consolidation and pleural effusion in ultrasound videos. We show that, with only a very small amount of additional frame-annotated data, the method provides strong model interpretability through localization and achieves state-of-the-art detection and classification, outperforming both direct video classifiers and comparable frame-based detectors trained without the added temporal context.",No
iccvw_2023_256,Order-ViT: Order Learning Vision Transformer for Cancer Classification in Pathology Images.,"In computational pathology, cancer classification is one of the most widely studied tasks. There exist numerous tools for cancer classification, which are mainly built based upon convolutional neural networks or Transformers. These tools, by and large, formulate cancer classification as a categorical classification problem, which ignores the intrinsic relationship among cancer grades. Herein, we propose an order learning vision transformer for cancer classification that can not only learn the histopathological patterns of individual cancer grades but also utilize the ordering relationship among cancer grades. Built based upon vision transformer, the proposed method simultaneously conducts categorical classification per input sample and order classification for a pair of input and reference samples. Moreover, it introduces a voting scheme to identify less confident samples and to improve the accuracy of the decision on such samples. The proposed method is evaluated on two types of cancer datasets including colorectal and gastric cancers. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other classification models and can facilitate improved cancer diagnosis in clinics.",No

iccvw_2023_258,A Comparative Study of Vision Transformer Encoders and Few-shot Learning for Medical Image Classification.,"Recently, computer vision has been significantly impacted by Vision Transformer (ViT) networks. These deep models have also succeeded in medical image classification. However, most existing deep learning-based methods primarily rely on a lot of labeled data to train reliable classifiers for accurate prediction. This requirement might be impractical in the medical field, where the data is limited and manual annotation is expensive. Therefore, this study explores the application of ViT in few-shot learning scenarios for medical image analysis, addressing the challenges posed by limited data availability. We evaluate various ViT models alongside few-shot learning algorithms (i.e., ProtoNet, MatchingNet, and Reptile), perform cross-domain experiments, and analyze the impact of data augmentation techniques. Our findings indicate that when combined with ProtoNets, ViT architectures outperform CNN-based counterparts and achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets. Cross-domain experiments further reveal the effectiveness of ViT models in few-shot medical image classification.",No
iccvw_2023_259,RheumaVIT: transformer-based model for Automated Scoring of Hand Joints in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation, joint destruction, and extra-articular manifestations. Radiography is the standard imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring joint damage in RA. However, the commonly used Sharp method and its variants, which evaluate radiographic progression, are time-consuming and subjective. Automated joint evaluation using deep neural networks can address these challenges. This study introduces RheumaVIT, a novel vision transformer-based pipeline for automatically scoring hand joints affected by RA. The method consists of two stages: a regression model for joint localization and a transformer-based architecture for assessing erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN). Our approach demonstrates superior accuracy (up to 12% higher for erosion and 2% higher for JSN) compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it has a promising ability to detect common patterns of erosion and JSN through roll-out interpretation. To promote further research, we are open-sourcing our clinical collection since there is no annotated dataset on RA available in the public domain. Our paper contributes to the progress of automated joint assessment in rheumatoid arthritis, offering potential applications in both clinical practice and research.",No
iccvw_2023_260,AW-Net: A Novel Fully Connected Attention-based Medical Image Segmentation Model.,"Multimodal medical imaging poses a unique challenge to the data scientist looking at that data, since it is not only voluminous, but also extremely heterogenous. In this paper, we have proposed a novel fully connected AW-Net which provides a solution to problem of segmenting multi-modal 3D/4D medical images by incorporating a novel regularized transient block. The AW-Net uses the concept of stacking of consecutive 2D image slices to extract spatial information for segmentation. Furthermore, dropout layers are incorporated to reduce the computational cost without affecting the accuracy of the output predicted masks. The AW-Net has been tested on benchmark datasets such as BRATS2020 for brain MRI, RSNA2022 cervical spine dataset for spine CT followed by DUKE and QIN dataset for breast MRI and PET respectively. The AW-Net achieves a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 81.3% and 80.5% for breast cancer segmentation from DCE and T1 images, 89.6% as an average of three segmented tumor classes for brain tumor segmentation from BraTS2020 dataset, 93.7% for breast tumor segmentation from breast PET images, and 71.9% for cervical fracture localization on the RSNA 2022 challenge. These evaluation experiments performed on public datasets indicate that the proposed AW-Net is a generalized, reproducible, efficient, and highly accurate model capable of segmenting and localizing anomalies in any multi-modal 3D/4D medical imaging data from small and large data sets.

iccvw_2023_261,Geodesic Regression Characterizes 3D Shape Changes in the Female Brain During Menstruation.,"Women are at higher risk of Alzheimerâ€™s and other neurological diseases after menopause, and yet research connecting female brain health to sex hormone fluctuations is limited. We seek to investigate this connection by developing tools that quantify 3D shape changes that occur in the brain during sex hormone fluctuations. Geodesic regression on the space of 3D discrete surfaces offers a principled way to characterize the evolution of a brainâ€™s shape. However, in its current form, this approach is too computationally expensive for practical use. In this paper, we propose approximation schemes that accelerate geodesic regression on shape spaces of 3D discrete surfaces. We also provide rules of thumb for when each approximation can be used. We test our approach on synthetic data to quantify the speed-accuracy trade-off of these approximations and show that practitioners can expect very significant speed-up while only sacrificing little accuracy. Finally, we apply the method to real brain shape data and produce the first characterization of how the female hippocampus changes shape during the menstrual cycle as a function of progesterone: a characterization made (practically) possible by our approximation schemes. Our work paves the way for comprehensive, practical shape analyses in the fields of bio-medicine and computer vision. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub.",No

iccvw_2023_263,Towards Robust Natural-Looking Mammography Lesion Synthesis on Ipsilateral Dual-Views Breast Cancer Analysis.,"In recent years, many mammographic image analysis methods have been introduced for improving cancer classification tasks. Two major issues of mammogram classification tasks are leveraging multi-view mammographic information and class-imbalance handling. In the first problem, many multi-view methods have been released for concatenating features of two or more views for the training and inference stage. Having said that, most multi-view existing methods are not explainable in the meaning of feature fusion, and treat many views equally for diagnosing. Our work aims to propose a simple but novel method for enhancing examined view (main view) by leveraging low-level feature information from the auxiliary view (ipsilateral view) before learning the high-level feature that contains the cancerous features. For the second issue, we also propose a simple but novel malignant mammogram synthesis framework for upsampling minor class samples. Our easy-to-implement and no-training framework has eliminated the current limitation of the CutMix algorithm which are unreliable synthesized images with random pasted patches, hard-contour problems, and domain shift problems. Our results on VinDr-Mammo and CMMD datasets show the effectiveness of our two new frameworks for both multi-view training and synthesizing mammographic images, outperforming the previous conventional methods in our experimental settings.",No

While recent DL-based CT segmentation outperformed traditional methods in terms of accuracy and automation, these methods input a ""reconstructed"" CT. Thus, its performance highly depends on the CT image quality. The reliance prohibits the application of these techniques for sparse-view CT, whereas the sparse-view CT is another important technique to reduce radiation dose and image acquisition time. Our end-to-end deep learning technique integrates the reconstruction and segmentation within a single neural network, which allows us to improve the segmentation quality for sparse-view CT data. The proposed method extracts fragments of pixels from each multi-energy projection corresponding to a bar of CT image voxels. In this way, our network, comprising ""filtering"", ""back-projection,"" and ""segmentation"" sub-networks, directly obtains the segmented CT image directly from projections. Our CT segmentation on a bar-by-bar basis is significantly memory-efficient due to the independence of memory-expensive 3D convolution. Consequently, our method delivers high-quality segmentation, where the problems of sparse-view artifacts and memory-expensiveness of prior methods are resolved.",No
iccvw_2023_265,Combating Coronary Calcium Scoring Bias for Non-gated CT by Semantic Learning on Gated CT.,"Coronary calcium scoring (CCS) can be quantified on non-gated or gated computed tomography (CT) for screening cardiovascular disease (CVD). And non-gated CT is used for routine coronary artery calcium (CAC) screening due to its affordability. However, artifacts of non-gated CT imaging, pose a significant challenge for automatic scoring. To combat the scoring bias caused by artifacts, we develop a novel semantic-prompt scoring siamese (SPSS) network for automatic CCS of non-gated CT. In SPSS, we establish a sharing network with regression supervised learning and semantic supervised learning. We train the SPSS by mixing non-gated CT without CAC mask and gated CT with CAC mask. In regression supervised learning, the network is trained to predict the CCS of non-gated CT. To combat the influence of motion artifacts, we introduce semantic supervised learning. We utilize gated CT to train the network to learn more accurate CAC semantic features. By integrating regression supervised learning and semantic supervised learning, the semantic information can prompt the regression supervised learning to accurately predict the CCS of non-gated CT. By conducting extensive experiments on publicly available dataset, we prove that the SPSS can alleviate the potential scoring bias introduced by pixel-wise artifact labels. Moreover, our experimental results show that the SPSS establishes state-of-the-art performance.",No

The proposed method harnesses the capabilities of the YOLOv8 model for approximate boundary box detection across modalities, alongside the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and High Quality (HQ) SAM for fully automatic and precise segmentation. To generate boundary boxes, the YOLOv8 model was trained using a limited set of 100 images and masks from each modality.The results obtained from our approach are extensively computed and analyzed, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential in medical image analysis. Various evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and Dice Score, were employed to quantify the accuracy of the segmentation results. A comparative analysis was conducted to assess the individual and combined performance of the YOLOv8, YOLOv8+SAM, and YOLOv8+HQ-SAM models.The results indicate that the SAM model performs better than the other two models, exhibiting higher segmentation accuracy and overall performance. While HQ-SAM offers potential advantages, its incremental gains over the standard SAM model may not justify the additional computational cost.

Confounders are spurious features that models tend to rely on, which can result in unexpected errors in regulated or safety-critical domains. The paper highlights the benefit of CFKD in such domains and shows some advantages of counterfactual explanations over other types of explanations. We propose an experiment scheme to quantitatively evaluate the success of CFKD and different teachers that can give feedback to the model. We also introduce a new metric that is better correlated with true test performance than validation accuracy. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of CFKD on synthetically augmented datasets and on real-world histopathological datasets.",No
iccvw_2023_269,Causality-Driven One-Shot Learning for Prostate Cancer Grading from MRI.,"In this paper, we present a novel method for the automatic classification of medical images that learns and leverages weak causal signals in the image. Our framework consists of a convolutional neural network backbone and a causality-extractor module which extracts cause-effect relationships between feature maps that can inform the model on the appearance of a feature in one place of the image, given the presence of another feature within some other place of the image. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in low-data scenarios, we train our causality-driven architecture in a One-shot learning scheme where we propose a new meta-learning procedure which entails meta-training and meta-testing tasks that are designed using related classes but at different levels of granularity. We conduct binary and multi-class classification experiments on a publicly available dataset of prostate MRI images. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed causality-driven module, we perform an ablation study and conduct qualitative assessments using class activation maps to highlight regions strongly influencing the networkâ€™s decision-making process. Our findings show that causal relationships among features play a crucial role in enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to discern relevant information and yielding more reliable and interpretable predictions. This would make it a promising approach for medical image classification tasks.",No
iccvw_2023_270,ShaRPy: Shape Reconstruction and Hand Pose Estimation from RGB-D with Uncertainty.,"Despite their potential, markerless hand tracking technologies are not yet applied in practice to the diagnosis or monitoring of the activity in inflammatory musculoskeletal diseases. One reason is that the focus of most methods lies in the reconstruction of coarse, plausible poses, whereas in the clinical context, accurate, interpretable, and reliable results are required. Therefore, we propose ShaRPy, the first RGB-D Shape Reconstruction and hand Pose tracking system, which provides uncertainty estimates of the computed pose, e.g., when a finger is hidden or its estimate is inconsistent with the observations in the input, to guide clinical decision-making. Besides pose, ShaRPy approximates a personalized hand shape, promoting a more realistic and intuitive understanding of its digital twin. Our method requires only a light-weight setup with a single consumer-level RGB-D camera yet it is able to distinguish similar poses with only small joint angle deviations in a metrically accurate space. This is achieved by combining a data-driven dense correspondence predictor with traditional energy minimization. To bridge the gap between interactive visualization and biomedical simulation we leverage a parametric hand model in which we incorporate biomedical constraints and optimize for both, its pose and hand shape. We evaluate ShaRPy on a keypoint detection benchmark and show qualitative results of hand function assessments for activity monitoring of musculoskeletal diseases.",No
iccvw_2023_271,An Empirical Analysis for Zero-Shot Multi-Label Classification on COVID-19 CT Scans and Uncurated Reports.,"The pandemic resulted in vast repositories of unstructured data, including radiology reports, due to increased medical examinations. Previous research on automated diagnosis of COVID-19 primarily focuses on X-ray images, despite their lower precision compared to computed tomography (CT) scans. In this work, we leverage unstructured data from a hospital and harness the fine-grained details offered by CT scans to perform zero-shot multi-label classification based on contrastive visual language learning. In collaboration with human experts, we investigate the effectiveness of multiple zero-shot models that aid radiologists in detecting pulmonary embolisms and identifying intricate lung details like ground glass opacities and consolidations. Our empirical analysis provides an overview of the possible solutions to target such fine-grained tasks, so far overlooked in the medical multimodal pretraining literature. Our investigation promises future advancements in the medical image analysis community by addressing some challenges associated with unstructured data and fine-grained multi-label classification.",No
iccvw_2023_272,Fusion Approaches to Predict Post-stroke Aphasia Severity from Multimodal Neuroimaging Data.,"This paper explores feature selection and fusion methods for predicting the clinical outcome of post-stroke aphasia from medical imaging data. Utilizing a multimodal neu-roimaging dataset derived from 55 individuals with chronic aphasia resulting from left-hemisphere lesions following a stroke, two distinct approaches, namely Early Fusion and Late Fusion, were developed using Support Vector Regression or Random Forest regression models for prognosticating patientsâ€™ functional communication skills measured by Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) test scores. A supervised learning method is proposed to reduce the number of features derived from each imaging modality. The fusion approaches were then applied to find combinations of these reduced feature sets that yield the most accurate WAB predictions. The same nested training/validation/test sets were used for the feature selection and fusion methods. Experiments showed that the best model based on the correlation metric is a Late Fusion RF model (r=0.63), while the best model based on the RMSE is an Early Fusion SVR model (RMSE=16.72). Experiments also revealed several feature set combinations that yielded more accurate predictions than both single-modality feature sets and feature sets that combine all modalities, justifying both fusion and reduction of features derived from multimodal neuroimaging data. It was also found that the percentage of tissue in gray matter regions of the brain, spared by the stroke as identified on structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is the single feature set that appeared in all highest ranked feature set combinations of both fusion approaches.",No
iccvw_2023_273,Self-supervised Semantic Segmentation: Consistency over Transformation.,"Accurate medical image segmentation is of utmost importance for enabling automated clinical decision procedures. However, prevailing supervised deep learning approaches for medical image segmentation encounter significant challenges due to their heavy dependence on extensive labeled training data. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised algorithm, S3-Net, which integrates a robust framework based on the proposed Inception Large Kernel Attention (I-LKA) modules. This architectural enhancement makes it possible to comprehensively capture contextual information while preserving local intricacies, thereby enabling precise semantic segmentation. Furthermore, considering that lesions in medical images often exhibit deformations, we leverage deformable convolution as an integral component to effectively capture and delineate lesion deformations for superior object boundary definition. Additionally, our self-supervised strategy emphasizes the acquisition of invariance to affine transformations, which is commonly encountered in medical scenarios. This emphasis on robustness with respect to geometric distortions significantly enhances the modelâ€™s ability to accurately model and handle such distortions. To enforce spatial consistency and promote the grouping of spatially connected image pixels with similar feature representations, we introduce a spatial consistency loss term. This aids the network in effectively capturing the relationships among neighboring pixels and enhancing the overall segmentation quality. The S3-Net approach iteratively learns pixel-level feature representations for image content clustering in an end-to-end manner. Our experimental results on skin lesion and lung organ segmentation tasks show the superior performance of our method compared to the SOTA approaches. Github.",No
iccvw_2023_274,ALFA - Leveraging All Levels of Feature Abstraction for Enhancing the Generalization of Histopathology Image Classification Across Unseen Hospitals.,"We propose an exhaustive methodology that leverages all levels of feature abstraction, targeting an enhancement in the generalizability of image classification to unobserved hospitals. Our approach incorporates augmentation-based self-supervision with common distribution shifts in histopathology scenarios serving as the pretext task. This enables us to derive invariant features from training images without relying on training labels, thereby covering different abstraction levels. Moving onto the subsequent abstraction level, we employ a domain alignment module to facilitate further extraction of invariant features across varying training hospitals. To represent the highly specific features of participating hospitals, an encoder is trained to classify hospital labels, independent of their diagnostic labels. The features from each of these encoders are subsequently disentangled to minimize redundancy and segregate the features. This representation, which spans a broad spectrum of semantic information, enables the development of a model demonstrating increased robustness to unseen images from disparate distributions. Experimental results from the PACS dataset (a domain generalization benchmark), a synthetic dataset created by applying histopathology-specific jitters to the MHIST dataset (defining different domains with varied distribution shifts), and a Renal Cell Carcinoma dataset derived from four image repositories from TCGA, collectively indicate that our proposed model is adept at managing varying levels of image granularity. Thus, it shows improved generalizability when faced with new, out-of-distribution hospital images. The code is available at: https://github.com/miladsikaroudi/ALFA.",No
iccvw_2023_275,Pathology-Based Ischemic Stroke Etiology Classification via Clot Composition Guided Multiple Instance Learning.,"Accurate identification of the etiology of acute ischemic stroke is crucial to prevent secondary strokes. With the growing utilization of endovascular thrombectomy as a treatment for acute ischemic stroke, there has been an increased interest in analyzing the removed clot tissue, opening possibilities for developing histology-based automated diagnostic methods for clot etiology prediction. In this paper, we propose an automated pipeline for Pathology-Based Ischemic Stroke Etiology Classification via Clot Composition Guided Multiple Instance Learning, that leverages the heterogeneity of the main clot components, specifically red blood cells (RBCs) and fibrin, to predict clot etiology solely using digital pathology data. We combine a publicly available dataset from 11 different medical Centers with a private dataset from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). We train the model using center-wise leave-one-out cross-validation to create a model that can generalize to all 12 Centers. Additionally, we compare three different self-supervised methods for embedding the histology data from whole slide images (WSIs) for a downstream task and found that combining two feature sets results in the best performance for our dataset. Our solution resulted in 0.762Â±0.141 AUC and 0.869Â±0.139 PRAUC for differentiation between large-artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolic clot etiology. These results hint at the potential to construct a generalizable model for clot etiology prediction. Such a model could assist in treatment planning, thereby helping reduce the likelihood of recurrent strokes.",No
iccvw_2023_276,Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation: Optimizing Cross-Entropy Weights and Post-Processing with Autoencoders.,"The task of medical image segmentation presents unique challenges, necessitating both localized and holistic semantic understanding to accurately delineate areas of interest, such as critical tissues or aberrant features. This complexity is heightened in medical image segmentation due to the high degree of inter-class similarities, intra-class variations, and possible image obfuscation. The segmentation task further diversifies when considering the study of histopathology slides for autoimmune diseases like dermatomyositis. The analysis of cell inflammation and interaction in these cases has been less studied due to constraints in data acquisition pipelines. Despite the progressive strides in medical science, we lack a comprehensive collection of autoimmune diseases. As autoimmune diseases globally escalate in prevalence and exhibit associations with COVID-19, their study becomes increasingly essential. While there is existing research that integrates artificial intelligence in the analysis of various autoimmune diseases, the exploration of dermatomyositis remains relatively underrepresented. In this paper, we present a deep-learning approach tailored for Medical image segmentation. Our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques by an average of 12.26% for U-Net and 12.04% for U-Net++ across the ResNet family of encoders on the dermatomyositis dataset. Furthermore, we probe the importance of optimizing loss function weights and benchmark our methodology on three challenging medical image segmentation tasks.",No

As the input to the LTI model, we provide the targeted instantiation of a generic but succinct prompt structure designed upon careful observations of the conditional narratives from the standard medical textbooks. In this regard, we pave the path to utilizing accessible textbook descriptions for automated diagnosis of conditions with data scarcity through the lens of LTI models. Experiments show the efficacy of the proposed framework, including much better localization of the infected regions. Moreover, it has the immense possibility for generalization across the medical sub-domains to mitigate the data scarcity issue, and debias automated diagnostics from the all-pervasive racial biases.",No

This paper introduces our solution to the ICCV CVAMD 2023 Shared Task on CXR-LT: Multi-Label Long-Tailed Classification on Chest X-Rays. Our approach introduces CheXFusion, a transformer-based fusion module incorporating multi-view images. The fusion module, guided by self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, efficiently aggregates multi-view features while considering label co-occurrence. Furthermore, we explore data balancing and self-training methods to optimize the modelâ€™s performance. Our solution achieves state-of-the-art results with 0.372 mAP in the MIMIC-CXR test set, securing 1st place in the competition.

iccvw_2023_279,Robust Asymmetric Loss for Multi-Label Long-Tailed Learning.,"In real medical data, training samples typically show long-tailed distributions with multiple labels. Class distribution of the medical data has a long-tailed shape, in which the incidence of different diseases is quite varied, and at the same time, it is not unusual for images taken from symptomatic patients to be multi-label diseases. Therefore, in this paper, we concurrently address these two issues by putting forth a robust asymmetric loss on the polynomial function. Since our loss tackles both long-tailed and multi-label classification problems simultaneously, it leads to a complex design of the loss function with a large number of hyper-parameters. Although a model can be highly fine-tuned due to a large number of hyper-parameters, it is difficult to optimize all hyper-parameters at the same time, and there might be a risk of overfitting a model. Therefore, we regularize the loss function using the Hill loss approach, which is beneficial to be less sensitive against the numerous hyper-parameters so that it reduces the risk of overfitting the model. For this reason, the proposed loss is a generic method that can be applied to most medical image classification tasks and does not make the training process more time-consuming. We demonstrate that the proposed robust asymmetric loss performs favorably against the long-tailed with multi-label medical image classification in addition to the various long-tailed single-label datasets. Notably, our method achieves Top-5 results on the CXR-LT dataset of the ICCV CVAMD 2023 competition. We opensource our implementation of the robust asymmetric loss in the public repository: https://github.com/kalelpark/RALoss.",No
iccvw_2023_280,Effect of Stage Training for Long-Tailed Multi-Label Image Classification.,"In this study, we focus on the multi-stage training approach for training image classification models in the ICCV CVAMD 2023 Shared Task CXR-LT: Multi-Label LongTailed Classification on Chest X-Rays. In the proposed approach, the input image size and batch size are adjusted at each stage of the training process. In the first stage, we use a smaller input image size and a larger batch size for model training. Following that, we increase the image size and reduce the batch size in the second stage. A thorough search of the related literature did not yield validations of a similar approach for data with a long-tailed distribution. We successfully balance accelerated model training and performance by combining the proposed technique with various enhancements, such as oversampling, postprocessing using view positions, and ensemble methods, despite using a smaller model architecture and smaller input image size.",No
iccvw_2023_281,Advanced Augmentation and Ensemble Approaches for Classifying Long-Tailed Multi-Label Chest X-Rays.,"Chest radiography is a common medical diagnostic procedure, often resulting in a long-tailed distribution of clinical findings. This challenges standard deep learning methods, which tend to favor more common classes and might miss less frequent but equally important ""tail"" classes. Chest X-ray diagnoses represent a multi-label problem due to the potential for multiple simultaneous diseases in patients. In this paper, we propose straightforward yet highly effective techniques to address the long-tailed imbalance in chest X-ray datasets. We specifically utilize EfficientNetV2 and ConvNeXt as our primary architectures, allowing the image sizes to influence architectural decisions. To counter dataset imbalance, we employ various basic and advanced augmentations. Mosaic augmentation is applied, and we alter the method of obtaining the label to manage this multilabel classification problem. We leverage the Binary Focal Cross-Entropy loss function and deploy several ensemble strategies to boost performance. These include Stratified K-Fold cross-validation and Test Time Augmentation. Our proposed method demonstrated its effectiveness during the Development and Testing phases of the CXR-LT: MultiLabel Long-Tailed Classification on Chest X-Rays competition.

iccvw_2023_282,An Optimized Ensemble Framework for Multi-Label Classification on Long-Tailed Chest X-ray Data.,"Chest X-rays (CXR) are essential in the diagnosis of lung disease, but CXR image classification is challenging because patients often have multiple diseases simultaneously. This requires multi-label classification to identify multiple abnormalities within a single image, which is complicated by different disease patterns and overlapping pathologies. In addition, CXR image classification faces the problem of long-tail distribution, with few common and mostly rare diseases, which can lead to biased predictions, especially for rare classes. There have been limited attempts to address these challenges in the medical domain, and applying general domain approaches to medical data may not be straightforward due to the unique characteristics of medical data. This paper presents an optimized ensemble framework to solve multi-label long-tailed classification on the MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, which is the main objective of the ICCV CVAMD 2023 workshop competition, CXR-LT: Multi-Label Long-Tailed Classification on Chest X-Rays. Various experiments have been conducted, from architecture design to data augmentation, to identify the most suitable components. The proposed framework improves the performance of the long-tail distribution classification problem on class-imbalanced multi-label medical images and is placed in the top ranks in the CXR-LT competition.",No
iccvw_2023_283,Enhancing Multi-Label Long-Tailed Classification on Chest X-Rays through ML-GCN Augmentation.,"The classification of multi-label thoracic images presents a considerable challenge due to the severe intrinsic imbalances inherent in the dataset. During the testing phase, the model encounters both predominant (head) and less frequent (tail) classes, demanding not only proficiency in image feature extraction but also a comprehensive understanding of label relationships. Traditional medical image classifiers have historically relied on exploiting a small number of dominant head classes. Nevertheless, this approach often yields suboptimal classification outcomes. To resolve this issue, we propose an enhanced version of the Multi-Label Graph Convolutional Network (ML-GCN). Our approach integrates the incorporation of experts, each focusing on distinct aspects of the input dataset, class-balanced sampling, Log-Sum-Pooling (LSE pooling), an attention layer, and regularization through KL divergence. By synergistically applying these techniques, our model significantly outperforms the baseline vanilla ML-GCN, capitalizing on nuanced architectural adjustments. Through this comprehensive approach, we effectively demonstrate the versatility of our model in addressing the specific task of multi-label long-tailed classification within the realm of chest X-ray datasets. Furthermore, our methodology exhibits promising potential for extension to a diverse array of datasets characterized by long-tailed distributions, establishing a strong foundation for its application within various domains.

iccvw_2023_284,Chest X-Ray Feature Pyramid Sum Model with Diseased Area Data Augmentation Method.,"Deep learning has shown considerable promise in medical image analysis, but significant challenges remain. These stem from the inherent complexities of medical images, such as varying sizes of lesions within the same image and the potential coexistence of multiple diseases. To address these issues, we propose a novel model combining TResNet with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). This model adeptly handles multi-label classification, demonstrating robust performance across a range of lesion sizes. Furthermore, most medical images follow a long-tail distribution, presenting class imbalance problems, where the occurrence of one lesion often correlates with the presence of others. Considering these correlations, we introduced a strategy for dealing with the class imbalance issue by augmenting minority classes using bounding box information of the disease. Our proposed approach offers a novel solution for handling the unique challenges in deep learning-based medical image analysis, paving the way for more precise interpretations of complex medical images. The performance of mAP in 26 disease classes has been improved from 32.76% to 33.37% in a single model, and 35.11% in ensemble model.",No
iccvw_2023_285,Sparse Linear Concept Discovery Models.,"The recent mass adoption of DNNs, even in safety-critical scenarios, has shifted the focus of the research community towards the creation of inherently intrepretable models. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) constitute a popular approach where hidden layers are tied to human understandable concepts allowing for investigation and correction of the network's decisions. However, CBMs usually suffer from: (i) performance degradation and (ii) lower interpretability than intended due to the sheer amount of concepts contributing to each decision. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly intuitive interpretable framework based on Contrastive Language Image models and a single sparse linear layer. In stark contrast to related approaches, the sparsity in our framework is achieved via principled Bayesian arguments by inferring concept presence via a data-driven Bernoulli distribution. As we experimentally show, our framework not only outperforms recent CBM approaches accuracy-wise, but it also yields high per example concept sparsity, facilitating the individual investigation of the emerging concepts.

iccvw_2023_287,Vision-Language Models Performing Zero-Shot Tasks Exhibit Disparities Between Gender Groups.,"We explore the extent to which zero-shot vision-language models exhibit gender bias for different vision tasks. Vision models traditionally required task-specific labels for representing concepts, as well as finetuning; zero-shot models like CLIP instead perform tasks with an open-vocabulary, meaning they do not need a fixed set of labels, by using text embeddings to represent concepts. With these capabilities in mind, we ask: Do vision-language models exhibit gender bias when performing zero-shot image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation? We evaluate different vision-language models with multiple datasets across a set of concepts and find (i) all models evaluated show distinct performance differences when identifying concepts based on the gender of the person co-occurring in the image (ii) model calibration (i.e., the relationship between accuracy and confidence) also differs distinctly by gender, even when evaluating on similar representations of concepts and (iii) these observed disparities align with existing gender biases in word embeddings from language models. These findings suggest that, while language greatly expands the capability of vision tasks, it can contribute to propagating social biases in zero-shot settings.",No
iccvw_2023_288,BiLMa: Bidirectional Local-Matching for Text-based Person Re-identification.,"Text-based person re-identification (TBPReID) aims to retrieve person images represented by a given textual query. In this task, how to effectively align images and texts globally and locally is a crucial challenge. Recent works have obtained high performances by solving Masked Language Modeling (MLM) to align image/text parts. However, they only performed uni-directional (i.e., from image to text) local-matching, leaving room for improvement by introducing opposite-directional (i.e., from text to image) localmatching. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional LocalMatching (BiLMa) framework that jointly optimize MLM and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in TBPReID model training. With this framework, our model is trained so as the labels of randomly masked both image and text tokens are predicted by unmasked tokens. In addition, to narrow the semantic gap between image and text in MIM, we propose Semantic MIM (SemMIM), in which the labels of masked image tokens are automatically given by a state-of-the-art human parser. Experimental results demonstrate that our BiLMa framework with SemMIM achieves state-of-the-art Rank@1 and mAP scores on three benchmarks.",No

To tackle these challenges, we propose the Alignment-generation Adapter (AGAdapter), establishing semantic coherence between alignment and generation models for efficient video-text adaptation across multiple tasks simultaneously. We propose an alignment adapter with knowledge-sharing to adapt the frozen CLIP model for fine-grained video-language interaction. Additionally, we introduce the generation adapter with prompt tuning to leverage the large language model for captioning.

In this paper, we propose LLaV-iLo (LLaMa-Video-Localizer), a video moment retrieval pipeline powered by a large language model. LLaViLo has two key features: 1) In contrast to fine-tuning the entire LLM, we introduce and optimize only 1.7% of additional parameters in adapter modules, freezing the pre-trained LLM to enable efficient alignment of video and text. 2) A multi-objective optimization framework concurrently op-timizes two objectives: a set prediction objective and a captioning objective.

Among these, the CLIP model has shown remarkable capabilities for zero-shot transfer by matching an image and a custom textual prompt in its latent space. This has paved the way for several works that focus on engineering or learning textual contexts for maximizing CLIPâ€™s classification capabilities. In this paper, we follow this trend by learning an ensemble of prompts for image classification. We show that learning diverse and possibly shorter contexts improves considerably and consistently the results rather than relying on a single trainable prompt. In particular, we report better few-shot capabilities with no additional cost at inference time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on 11 different benchmarks.",No

Previous studies often use a single dataset, in most cases collected by the authors themselves. We claim a cross-dataset approach would be more adequate to evaluate real-world scenarios. We investigate two methods based on spatial feature extraction. The first one uses pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the second one Body Landmark Estimation (skeleton information). A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is responsible for the sign classification. Our contribution encompasses data curation, alongside providing general guidelines for enhanced generalization.",No
iccvw_2023_294,Context-VQA: Towards Context-Aware and Purposeful Visual Question Answering.,"Visual question answering (VQA) has the potential to make the Internet more accessible in an interactive way, allowing people who cannot see images to ask questions about them. However, multiple studies have shown that people who are blind or have low-vision prefer image explanations that incorporate the context in which an image appears, yet current VQA datasets focus on images in isolation. We argue that VQA models will not fully succeed at meeting peopleâ€™s needs unless they take context into account. To further motivate and analyze the distinction between different contexts, we introduce Context-VQA1, a VQA dataset that pairs images with contexts, specifically types of websites (e.g., a shopping website). We find that the types of questions vary systematically across contexts. For example, images presented in a travel context garner 2 times more ""Where?"" questions, and images on social media and news garner 2.8 and 1.8 times more ""Who?"" questions than the average. We also find that context effects are especially important when participants canâ€™t see the image. These results demonstrate that context affects the types of questions asked and that VQA models should be context-sensitive to better meet peopleâ€™s needs, especially in accessibility settings.",No
iccvw_2023_295,Explaining Vision and Language through Graphs of Events in Space and Time.,"Artificial Intelligence makes great advances today and starts to bridge the gap between vision and language. However, we are still far from understanding, explaining and controlling explicitly the visual content from a linguistic perspective, because we still lack a common explainable representation between the two domains. In this work we come to address this limitation and propose the Graph of Events in Space and Time (GEST), by which we can represent, create and explain, both visual and linguistic stories. We provide a theoretical justification of our model and an experimental validation, which proves that GEST can bring a solid complementary value along powerful deep learning models. In particular, GEST can help improve at the content-level the generation of videos from text, by being easily incorporated into our novel video generation engine. Additionally, by using efficient graph matching techniques, the GEST graphs can also improve the comparisons between texts at the semantic level.",No
iccvw_2023_296,Mapping Memes to Words for Multimodal Hateful Meme Classification.,"Multimodal image-text memes are prevalent on the internet, serving as a unique form of communication that combines visual and textual elements to convey humor, ideas, or emotions. However, some memes take a malicious turn, promoting hateful content and perpetuating discrimination. Detecting hateful memes within this multimodal context is a challenging task that requires understanding the intertwined meaning of text and images. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a novel approach named ISSUES for multimodal hateful meme classification. ISSUES leverages a pre-trained CLIP vision-language model and the textual inversion technique to effectively capture the multimodal semantic content of the memes. The experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Hateful Memes Challenge and HarMeme datasets.

iccvw_2023_297,Cross-Modal Dense Passage Retrieval for Outside Knowledge Visual Question Answering.,"In many language processing tasks including most notably Large Language Modeling (LLM), retrieval augmentation improves the performance of the models by adding information during inference that may not be present in the modelâ€™s weights. This technique has been shown to be particularly useful in multimodal settings. For some tasks, like Outside Knowledge Visual Question Answering (OK-VQA), retrieval augmentation is required given the open nature of the knowledge. In many prior works for the OK-VQA task, the retriever is either a unimodal language retriever or an untrained cross-modal retriever. In this work, we present a weakly supervised training approach for cross-modal retrievers. Our method takes inspiration from the natural language modeling task of information retrieval and extends those methods to cross-modal retrieval. Since the OK-VQA task does not typically have consistent ground truth retrieval labels, we evaluate our model using lexical overlap between the ground truth and the retrieved passage.

For each figure, this dataset provides short and long captions, reference numerals, their corresponding terms, and the minimal claim set that describes the interactions between the components of the image.

iccvw_2023_299,An empirical study of the effect of video encoders on Temporal Video Grounding.,"Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.",No
iccvw_2023_300,Towards Vision-Language Mechanistic Interpretability: A Causal Tracing Tool for BLIP.,"Mechanistic interpretability seeks to understand the neural mechanisms that enable specific behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging causality-based methods. While these approaches have identified neural circuits that copy spans of text, capture factual knowledge, and more, they remain unusable for multimodal models since adapting these tools to the vision-language domain requires considerable architectural changes. In this work, we adapt a unimodal causal tracing tool to BLIP to enable the study of the neural mechanisms underlying image-conditioned text generation. We demonstrate our approach on a visual question answering dataset, highlighting the causal relevance of later layer representations for all tokens. Furthermore, we release our BLIP causal tracing tool as open source to enable further experimentation in vision-language mechanistic interpretability by the community. Our code is available at this URL.",No
iccvw_2023_301,Multimodal Neurons in Pretrained Text-Only Transformers.,"Language models demonstrate remarkable capacity to generalize representations learned in one modality to downstream tasks in other modalities. Can we trace this ability to individual neurons? We study the case where a frozen text transformer is augmented with vision using a self-supervised visual encoder and a single linear projection learned on an image-to-text task. Outputs of the projection layer are not immediately decodable into language describing image content; instead, we find that translation between modalities occurs deeper within the transformer. We introduce a procedure for identifying ""multimodal neurons"" that convert visual representations into corresponding text, and decoding the concepts they inject into the modelâ€™s residual stream. In a series of experiments, we show that multimodal neurons operate on specific visual concepts across inputs, and have a systematic causal effect on image captioning.

iccvw_2023_302,Looking at words and points with attention: a benchmark for text-to-shape coherence.,"While text-conditional 3D object generation and manipulation have seen rapid progress, the evaluation of coherence between generated 3D shapes and input textual descriptions lacks a clear benchmark. The reason is twofold: a) the low quality of the textual descriptions in the only publicly available dataset of text-shape pairs; b) the limited effectiveness of the metrics used to quantitatively assess such coherence. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive solution that addresses both weaknesses. Firstly, we employ large language models to automatically refine textual descriptions associated with shapes. Secondly, we propose a quantitative metric to assess text-to-shape coherence, through cross-attention mechanisms. To validate our approach, we conduct a user study and compare quantitatively our metric with existing ones. The refined dataset, the new metric and a set of text-shape pairs validated by the user study comprise a novel, fine-grained benchmark that we publicly release to foster research on text-to-shape coherence of text-conditioned 3D generative models.

iccvw_2023_303,BluNF: Blueprint Neural Field.,"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have revolutionized scene novel view synthesis, offering visually realistic, precise, and robust implicit reconstructions. While recent approaches enable NeRF editing, such as object removal, 3D shape modification, or material property manipulation, the manual annotation prior to such edits makes the process tedious. Additionally, traditional 2D interaction tools lack an accurate sense of 3D space, preventing precise manipulation and editing of scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called Blueprint Neural Field (BluNF), to address these editing issues. BluNF provides a robust and user-friendly 2D blueprint, enabling intuitive scene editing. By leveraging implicit neural representation, BluNF constructs a blueprint of a scene using prior semantic and depth information. The generated blueprint allows effortless editing and manipulation of NeRF representations. We demonstrate BluNFâ€™s editability through an intuitive click-and-change mechanism, enabling 3D manipulations, such as masking, appearance modification, and object removal. Our approach significantly contributes to visual content creation, paving the way for further research in this area.",No
iccvw_2023_304,NeRF-GAN Distillation for Efficient 3D-Aware Generation with Convolutions.,"Pose-conditioned convolutional generative models struggle with high-quality 3D-consistent image generation from single-view datasets, due to their lack of sufficient 3D priors. Recently, the integration of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has transformed 3D-aware generation from single-view images. NeRF-GANs exploit the strong inductive bias of neural 3D representations and volumetric rendering at the cost of higher computational complexity. This study aims at revisiting pose-conditioned 2D GANs for efficient 3D-aware generation at inference time by distilling 3D knowledge from pretrained NeRF-GANs. We propose a simple and effective method, based on re-using the well-disentangled latent space of a pre-trained NeRF-GAN in a pose-conditioned convolutional network to directly generate 3D-consistent images corresponding to the underlying 3D representations. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains results comparable with volumetric rendering in terms of quality and 3D consistency while benefiting from the computational advantage of convolutional networks.

iccvw_2023_305,LatentSwap3D: Semantic Edits on 3D Image GANs.,"3D GANs have the ability to generate latent codes for entire 3D volumes rather than only 2D images. These models offer desirable features like high-quality geometry and multi-view consistency, but, unlike their 2D counterparts, complex semantic image editing tasks for 3D GANs have only been partially explored. To address this problem, we propose LatentSwap3D, a semantic edit approach based on latent space discovery that can be used with any off-the-shelf 3D or 2D GAN model and on any dataset. LatentSwap3D relies on identifying the latent code dimensions corresponding to specific attributes by feature ranking using a random forest classifier. It then performs the edit by swapping the selected dimensions of the image being edited with the ones from an automatically selected reference image. Compared to other latent space control-based edit methods, which were mainly designed for 2D GANs, our method on 3D GANs provides remarkably consistent semantic edits in a disentangled manner and outperforms others both qualitatively and quantitatively. We show results on seven 3D GANs (Ï€-GAN, GIRAFFE, StyleSDF, MVCGAN, EG3D, StyleNeRF, and VolumeGAN) and on five datasets (FFHQ, AFHQ, Cats, MetFaces, and CompCars).",No
iccvw_2023_306,BuilDiff: 3D Building Shape Generation using Single-Image Conditional Point Cloud Diffusion Models.,"3D building generation with low data acquisition costs, such as single image-to-3D, becomes increasingly important. However, most of the existing single image-to-3D building creation works are restricted to those images with specific viewing angles, hence they are difficult to scale to general-view images that commonly appear in practical cases. To fill this gap, we propose a novel 3D building shape generation method exploiting point cloud diffusion models with image conditioning schemes, which demonstrates flexibility to the input images. By cooperating two conditional diffusion models and introducing a regularization strategy during denoising process, our method is able to synthesize building roofs while maintaining the overall structures. We validate our framework on two newly built datasets and extensive experiments show that our method outperforms previous works in terms of building generation quality.",No
iccvw_2023_307,Set-the-Scene: Global-Local Training for Generating Controllable NeRF Scenes.,"Recent breakthroughs in text-guided image generation have led to remarkable progress in the field of 3D synthesis from text. By optimizing neural radiance fields (NeRF) directly from text, recent methods are able to produce remarkable results. Yet, these methods are limited in their control of each objectâ€™s placement or appearance, as they represent the scene as a whole. This can be a major issue in scenarios that require refining or manipulating objects in the scene. To remedy this deficit, we propose a novel Global-Local training framework for synthesizing a 3D scene using object proxies. A proxy represents the objectâ€™s placement in the generated scene and optionally defines its coarse geometry. The key to our approach is to represent each object as an independent NeRF. We alternate between optimizing each NeRF on its own and as part of the full scene. Thus, a complete representation of each object can be learned, while also creating a harmonious scene with style and lighting match. We show that using proxies allows a wide variety of editing options, such as adjusting the placement of each independent object, removing objects from a scene, or refining an object. Our results show that Set-the-Scene offers a powerful solution for scene synthesis and manipulation, filling a crucial gap in controllable text-to-3D synthesis.",No
iccvw_2023_308,SPARF: Large-Scale Learning of 3D Sparse Radiance Fields from Few Input Images.,"Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) treat the problem of novel view synthesis as Sparse Radiance Field (SRF) optimization using sparse voxels for efficient and fast rendering [14], [43]. In order to leverage machine learning and adoption of SRFs as a 3D representation, we present SPARF, a large-scale ShapeNet-based synthetic dataset for novel view synthesis consisting of ~17 million images rendered from nearly 40,000 shapes at high resolution (400 Ã— 400 pixels). The dataset is orders of magnitude larger than existing synthetic datasets for novel view synthesis and includes more than one million 3D-optimized radiance fields with multiple voxel resolutions. Furthermore, we propose a novel pipeline (SuRFNet) that learns to generate sparse voxel radiance fields from only few views. This is done by using the densely collected SPARF dataset and 3D sparse convolutions. SuRFNet employs partial SRFs from few/one images and a specialized SRF loss to learn to generate high-quality sparse voxel radiance fields that can be rendered from novel views. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in the task of unconstrained novel view synthesis based on few views on ShapeNet as compared to recent baselines.

iccvw_2023_309,Blended-NeRF: Zero-Shot Object Generation and Blending in Existing Neural Radiance Fields.,"Editing a local region or a specific object in a 3D scene represented by a NeRF or consistently blending a new realistic object into the scene is challenging, mainly due to the implicit nature of the scene representation. We present Blended-NeRF, a robust and flexible framework for editing a specific region of interest in an existing NeRF scene, based on text prompts, along with a 3D ROI box. Our method leverages a pretrained language-image model to steer the synthesis towards a user-provided text prompt, along with a 3D MLP model initialized on an existing NeRF scene to generate the object and blend it into a specified region in the original scene. We allow local editing by localizing a 3D ROI box in the input scene, and blend the content synthesized inside the ROI with the existing scene using a novel volumetric blending technique. To obtain natural looking and view-consistent results, we leverage existing and new geometric priors and 3D augmentations for improving the visual fidelity of the final result. We test our framework both qualitatively and quantitatively on a variety of real 3D scenes and text prompts, demonstrating realistic multi-view consistent results with much flexibility and diversity compared to the baselines. Finally, we show the applicability of our framework for several 3D editing applications, including adding new objects to a scene, removing/replacing/altering existing objects, and texture conversion.",No

iccvw_2023_311,Is there progress in activity progress prediction?,"Activity progress prediction aims to estimate what percentage of an activity has been completed. Currently this is done with machine learning approaches, trained and evaluated on complicated and realistic video datasets. The videos in these datasets vary drastically in length and appearance. And some of the activities have unanticipated developments, making activity progression difficult to estimate. In this work, we examine the results obtained by existing progress prediction methods on these datasets. We find that current progress prediction methods seem not to extract useful visual information for the progress prediction task. Therefore, these methods fail to exceed simple frame-counting baselines. We design a precisely controlled dataset for activity progress prediction and on this synthetic dataset we show that the considered methods can make use of the visual information, when this directly relates to the progress prediction. We conclude that the progress prediction task is ill-posed on the currently used real-world datasets. Moreover, to fairly measure activity progression we advise to consider a, simple but effective, frame-counting baseline.",No
iccvw_2023_312,Are current long-term video understanding datasets long-term?,"Many real-world applications, from sport analysis to surveillance, benefit from automatic long-term action recognition. In the current deep learning paradigm for automatic action recognition, it is imperative that models are trained and tested on datasets and tasks that evaluate if such models actually learn and reason over long-term information. In this work, we propose a method to evaluate how suitable a video dataset is to evaluate models for long-term action recognition. To this end, we define a long-term action as excluding all the videos that can be correctly recognized using solely short-term information. We test this definition on existing long-term classification tasks on three popular real-world datasets, namely Breakfast, CrossTask and LVU, to determine if these datasets are truly evaluating long-term recognition. Our study reveals that these datasets can be effectively solved using shortcuts based on short-term information. Following this finding, we encourage long-term action recognition researchers to make use of datasets that need long-term information to be solved.",No
iccvw_2023_313,VAST: Vivify Your Talking Avatar via Zero-Shot Expressive Facial Style Transfer.,"Current talking face generation methods mainly focus on speech-lip synchronization. However, insufficient investigation on the facial talking style leads to a lifeless and monotonous avatar. Most previous works fail to imitate expressive styles from arbitrary video prompts and ensure the authenticity of the generated video. This paper proposes an unsupervised variational style transfer model (VAST) to vivify the neutral photo-realistic avatars. Our model consists of three key components: a style encoder that extracts facial style representations from the given video prompts; a hybrid facial expression decoder to model accurate speech-related movements; a variational style enhancer that enhances the style space to be highly expressive and meaningful. With our essential designs on facial style learning, our model is able to flexibly capture the expressive facial style from arbitrary video prompts and transfer it onto a personalized image renderer in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed approach contributes to a more vivid talking avatar with higher authenticity and richer expressiveness.",No
iccvw_2023_314,PAT: Position-Aware Transformer for Dense Multi-Label Action Detection.,"We present PAT, a transformer-based network that learns complex temporal co-occurrence action dependencies in a video by exploiting multi-scale temporal features. In existing methods, the self-attention mechanism in transformers loses the temporal positional information, which is essential for robust action detection. To address this issue, we (i) embed relative positional encoding in the self-attention mechanism and (ii) exploit multi-scale temporal relationships by designing a novel non-hierarchical network, in contrast to the recent transformer-based approaches that use a hierarchical structure. We argue that joining the self-attention mechanism with multiple sub-sampling processes in the hierarchical approaches results in increased loss of positional information. We evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on two challenging dense multi-label benchmark datasets, and show that PAT improves the current state-of-the-art result by 1.1% and 0.6% mAP on the Charades and MultiTHUMOS datasets, respectively, thereby achieving the new state-of-the-art mAP at 26.5% and 44.6%, respectively.

iccvw_2023_315,Expressive Talking Head Video Encoding in StyleGAN2 Latent Space.,"While the recent advances in research on video reenactment have yielded promising results, the existing approaches fall short in capturing the fine, detailed, and expressive facial features (e.g., lip-pressing, mouth puckering, mouth gaping, and wrinkles), which are crucial in generating realistic animated face videos. To this end, we propose an end-to-end expressive face video encoding approach that facilitates data-efficient high-quality video resynthesis by optimizing low-dimensional edits of a single Identity-latent. The approach builds on StyleGAN2 image inversion and multi-stage non-linear latent space editing to generate videos that are nearly comparable to input videos. While existing StyleGAN latent-based editing techniques focus on simply generating plausible edits of static images, we automate the latent space editing to capture the fine expressive facial deformations in a sequence of frames using an encoding that resides in the Style-latent space (StyleSpace) of StyleGAN2. The encoding thus obtained could be super-imposed on a single Identity-latent to facilitate reenactment of high-resolution face videos at 10242. The proposed framework economically captures face identity, head-pose, and complex expressive facial motions at fine levels, and thereby bypasses training, person modeling, dependence on landmarks/keypoints, and low-resolution synthesis which tend to hamper most re-enactment approaches. The proposed method is designed with maximum data efficiency, where a single W+ latent and 35 parameters per frame enable high-fidelity video rendering. This pipeline can also be used for puppeteering (i.e., motion transfer). Project page: https://trevineoorloff.github.io/ExpressiveFaceVideoEncoding.io/.",No
iccvw_2023_316,Benchmarking Data Efficiency and Computational Efficiency of Temporal Action Localization Models.,"In temporal action localization, given an input video, the goal is to predict which actions it contains, where they begin, and where they end. Training and testing current state-of-the-art deep learning models requires access to large amounts of data and computational power. However, gathering such data is challenging and computational resources might be limited. This work explores and measures how current deep temporal action localization models perform in settings constrained by the amount of data or computational power. We measure data efficiency by training each model on a subset of the training set. We find that TemporalMaxer outperforms other models in data-limited settings. Furthermore, we recommend TriDet when training time is limited. To test the efficiency of the models during inference, we pass videos of different lengths through each model. We find that TemporalMaxer requires the least computational resources, likely due to its simple architecture.",No
iccvw_2023_317,InFusion: Inject and Attention Fusion for Multi Concept Zero-Shot Text-based Video Editing.,"Large text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating diverse, high-quality images. Additionally, these models have been successfully leveraged to edit input images by just changing the text prompt. But when these models are applied to videos, the main challenge is to ensure temporal consistency and coherence across frames. In this paper, we propose InFusion, a framework for zero-shot text-based video editing leveraging large pre-trained image diffusion models. Our framework specifically supports editing of multiple concepts with pixel-level control over diverse concepts mentioned in the editing prompt. Specifically, we inject the difference in features obtained with source and edit prompts from U-Net residual blocks of decoder layers. When these are combined with injected attention features, it becomes feasible to query the source contents and scale edited concepts along with the injection of unedited parts. The editing is further controlled in a fine-grained manner with mask extraction and attention fusion, which cut the edited part from the source and paste it into the denoising pipeline for the editing prompt. Our framework is a low-cost alternative to one-shot tuned models for editing since it does not require training. We demonstrated complex concept editing with a generalised image model (Stable Diffusion v1.5) using LoRA. Adaptation is compatible with all the existing image diffusion techniques. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of existing methods in rendering high-quality and temporally consistent videos.",No

In this work, we present LEMMS (Label Estimation of Multi-feature Movie Segments), a methodology to analyze and label 30-second-long movie editing patterns based on the following editing features: shot size, shot subject, editing pace, and editing trend. LEMMS can identify more or less fine-grained editing classes using a multi-clustering approach. To evaluate the robustness of LEMMS in assigning correct labels the performance of an LSTM classifier is analyzed. For our study, we extracted 24 363 segments of movie scenes from the AVE [1] dataset. The performance of LEMMS in semi-automatic label identification for 30-second long movie segments is accurate, as the proposed approach has an overall accuracy of 92.8% for 50 classes.",No
iccvw_2023_319,Pointing Gesture Recognition via Self-supervised Regularization for ASD Screening.,"The ability to point to objects for sharing social purpose or attention is known as one of the key indicators in distinguishing children with typical development (TD) from those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there is a lack of datasets specifically tailored for childrenâ€™s pointing gestures. This lack of training data from the target domain becomes a major factor in the performance degradation of conventional supervised CNNs due to domain shift. Toward an effective and practical solution, we propose an end-to-end learning scheme for domain generalized pointing gesture recognition adopting self-supervised regularization (SSR). To prove the effectiveness of our method in real-world situations, we designed a Social Interaction-Inducing Content (SIIC)-based ASD diagnostic system and collected an ASD-Pointing dataset consisting of 40 TD and ASD children. Through extensive experiments on our collected datasets, we achieved an ASD screening accuracy of 72.5%, showing that pointing ability can play a vital role as an indicator in distinguishing between ASD and TD.",No

In this work, the social intelligence-based Social-IQ dataset consisting of videos with visual, audio, and textual modalities is used for QA in such social contexts. Our approach involves the incorporation of external commonsense knowledge to deal with the lack of reasoning in multimodal machine learning models in the context of question answering. In this work, we use Commonsense Transformers (COMET) to generate contextual information from the textual modality along VisualCOMET for the visual modality. These are incorporated into our model to improve binary QA accuracy over state-of-the-art methods and highlight the need for commonsense understanding in question-answering tasks.",No

We propose a dataset for detecting visual sentiment from art images, D-ViSA, whose labels consist of both categorical and dimensional emotion labels which can be implemented in a wide range of visual sentiment analysis research regarding art. We compare several deep learning baselines in two specific tasks, single-feature, and multi-feature dimensional emotion regression.

Dealing with human-centered phenomena requires, however, a considerable amount of manually annotated data, making data annotation a costly and challenging task that hinders the training of supervised learning algorithms. In this study, we apply an approach grounded on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to alleviate the annotation burden. As a test bed, we select emergent states analysis with specific reference to the team potency. At first, we build the POTENCY dataset by fusing three datasets on social interaction. Next, we compute a set of multimodal features characterizing the social behavior of the team members and the team as one. Finally, we feed the POTENCY dataset to a semi-supervised GCN, trained on a binary node classification task, with variable amounts of labels. We show that GCN can assign team potency labels to an unlabeled team in the dataset by using only a few labeled examples (i.e., 10% of data), with performances comparable to or higher than those of two baseline algorithms carrying out the same task in a fully supervised way.",No
iccvw_2023_323,Interaction acceptance modelling and estimation for a proactive engagement in the context of human-robot interactions.,"Understanding human behavior in social environments provides valuable insights and information. When individuals require interaction with others, they rapidly assess the likelihood of engagement based on social signals and the displayed activity of the potential partner of interaction. We refer to this cognitive process as the Interaction Acceptance Belief (IAB). The concept of IAB finds application in various social robotic scenarios, including service tasks, proactive approaches, and reactive methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive definition of Interaction Acceptance Belief and propose a methodology for its realistic modeling within real-world scenarios. Our approach aims to enhance the capabilities of social robots to effectively infer and adapt to human preferences, leading to efficient human-robot interactions. By conducting experimental evaluations, we establish the feasibility of developing a model that captures and represents the Interaction Acceptance Belief within a specific social context.",No

Recent artificial social intelligence models have achieved state-of-the-art results in question-answering tasks by employing a variety of methods, including self-supervised setups, multi-modal inputs, and so on. However, there is still a gap in the literature regarding the introduction of commonsense knowledge when training the model in social intelligence tasks. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Modal Temporal Correlated Network with Emotional Social Cues (MMTC-ESC).

iccvw_2023_326,GANDiffFace: Controllable Generation of Synthetic Datasets for Face Recognition with Realistic Variations.,"Face recognition systems have significantly advanced in recent years, driven by the availability of large-scale datasets. However, several issues have recently came up, including privacy concerns that have led to the discontinuation of well-established public datasets. Synthetic datasets have emerged as a solution, even though current synthesis methods present other drawbacks such as limited intraclass variations, lack of realism, and unfair representation of demographic groups. This study introduces GAN-DiffFace, a novel framework for the generation of synthetic datasets for face recognition that combines the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models to overcome the limitations of existing synthetic datasets. In GANDiffFace, we first propose the use of GANs to synthesize highly realistic identities and meet target demographic distributions. Subsequently, we fine-tune Diffusion models with the images generated with GANs, synthesizing multiple images of the same identity with a variety of accessories, poses, expressions, and contexts. We generate multiple synthetic datasets by changing GANDiffFace settings, and compare their mated and non-mated score distributions with the distributions provided by popular real-world datasets for face recognition, i.e. VGG2 and IJB-C. Our results show the feasibility of the proposed GANDiffFace, in particular the use of Diffusion models to enhance the (limited) intra-class variations provided by GANs towards the level of real-world datasets.",No
iccvw_2023_327,PoseBias: On Dataset Bias and Task Difficulty - Is there an Optimal Camera Position for Facial Image Analysis?,"Let's imagine you could choose the position of the camera for a particular face analysis task - where would you put it? In this work, we provide a first analysis based on synthetic training data to provide evidence that this choice is not trivial, not only dependent on the training data and different based on the task. We provide results for two major face analysis tasks, face recognition and landmark detection. For our experiments, we use a 3D Morphable Model as it provides us full control over pose, illumination, and identity to generate idealized training data. Whilst rendered images are not photorealistic we avoid any confounding factors and biases from other sources (e.g. pose bias in training data).Our results show that the optimal camera poses are near frontal but not exactly frontal and dependent on the task. By comparing the results obtained by pose-specific training set to a uniform training distribution without pose bias we show that the accuracy for both tasks not only depends on the bias in the training data but is actually dominated by the difficulty of the task depending on the particular pose.",No

However, most previous methods focus on heuristic designs without considering the spatial correlation between face images. In this paper, we aim to learn discriminative kinship representations embedded with the relation information between face components. To achieve this goal, we propose the Face Componential Relation Network (FaCoRNet), which learns the relationship between face components among images with a cross-attention mechanism, to automatically learn the important facial regions for kinship recognition. Moreover, we propose Relation-Guided Contrastive Learning, which adapts the loss function by the guidance from cross-attention to learn more discriminative feature representations. The proposed FaCoRNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins for experiments on multiple public kinship recognition benchmarks.

iccvw_2023_329,Disjoint Pose and Shape for 3D Face Reconstruction.,"Existing methods for 3D face reconstruction from a few casually captured images employ deep learning based models along with a 3D Morphable Model(3DMM) as face geometry prior. Structure From Motion(SFM), followed by Multi-View Stereo (MVS), on the other hand, uses dozens of high-resolution images to reconstruct accurate 3D faces. However, it produces noisy and stretched-out results with only two views available. In this paper, taking inspiration from both these methods, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that disjointly solves for pose and shape to make the optimization stable and accurate. We use a face shape prior to estimate face pose and use stereo matching followed by a 3DMM to solve for the shape. The proposed method achieves end-to-end topological consistency, enables iterative face pose refinement procedure, and show remarkable improvement on both quantitative and qualitative results over existing state-of-the-art methods.",No

In this paper, we propose music codes, a better latent representation for music features using discrete variables. We present a comprehensive analysis of the music features and propose a different normalization procedure to address the scale imbalance issue within music features. We also introduce the Music-to-Codes (M2C) network, a VQ-VAE inspired network as a music code extractor to replace existing music feature processors. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we combine M2C with Stochastic Motion GPT (SM-GPT), our modification of a recent SoTA dance generation method. Our extensive evaluation and ablation study demonstrates that our dance generation pipeline (using M2C and SM-GPT) significantly improves the dance generation result both qualitatively and quantitatively across all evaluation metrics. Our work opens up new possibilities for exploring the relationship between music and dance, contributing to more effective music-conditioned 3D dance generation.",No
iccvw_2023_331,Denoising Diffusion for 3D Hand Pose Estimation from Images.,"Hand pose estimation from a single image has many applications. However, approaches to full 3D body pose estimation are typically trained on day-to-day activities or actions. As such, detailed hand-to-hand interactions are poorly represented, especially during motion. We see this in the failure cases of techniques such as OpenPose [6] or MediaPipe[30]. However, accurate hand pose estimation is crucial for many applications where the global body motion is less important than accurate hand pose estimation.This paper addresses the problem of 3D hand pose estimation from monocular images or sequences. We present a novel end-to-end framework for 3D hand regression that employs diffusion models that have shown excellent ability to capture the distribution of data for generative purposes. Moreover, we enforce kinematic constraints to ensure realistic poses are generated by incorporating an explicit forward kinematic layer as part of the network. The proposed model provides state-of-the-art performance when lifting a 2D single-hand image to 3D. However, when sequence data is available, we add a Transformer module over a temporal window of consecutive frames to refine the results, overcoming jittering and further increasing accuracy.The method is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated showing state-of-the-art robustness, generalization, and accuracy on several different datasets.",No
iccvw_2023_332,POSTER: A Pyramid Cross-Fusion Transformer Network for Facial Expression Recognition.,"Facial expression recognition (FER) is an important task in computer vision, having practical applications in areas such as human-computer interaction, education, health-care, and online monitoring. In this challenging FER task, there are three key issues especially prevalent: inter-class similarity, intra-class discrepancy, and scale sensitivity. While existing works typically address some of these issues, none have fully addressed all three challenges in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a two-stream Pyramid crOss-fuSion TransformER network (POSTER), that aims to holistically solve all three issues. Specifically, we design a transformer-based cross-fusion method that enables effective collaboration of facial landmark features and image features to maximize proper attention to salient facial regions. Furthermore, POSTER employs a pyramid structure to promote scale invariance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our POSTER achieves new state-of-the-art results on RAF-DB (92.05%), FERPlus (91.62%), as well as AffectNet 7 class (67.31%) and 8 class (63.34%).

iccvw_2023_333,Dynamic Multiview Refinement of 3D Hand Datasets using Differentiable Ray Tracing.,"With the increase of AI applications in the field of 3D estimation of hand state, the quality of the datasets used for training the relevant models is of utmost importance. Especially in the case of datasets consisting of real-world images, the quality of annotations, i.e., how accurately the provided ground truth reflects the true state of the scene, can greatly affect the performance of downstream applications. In this work, we propose a methodology with significant impact on improving ubiquitous 3D hand geometry datasets that contain real images with imperfect annotations. Our approach leverages multi-view imagery, temporal consistency, and a disentangled representation of hand shape, texture, and environment lighting. This allows to refine the hand geometry of existing datasets and also paves the way for texture extraction. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms the current state of the art, resulting in more accurate and visually pleasing reconstructions of hand gestures.",No
iccvw_2023_334,Controllable Inversion of Black-Box Face Recognition Models via Diffusion.,"Face recognition models embed a face image into a low-dimensional identity vector containing abstract encodings of identity-specific facial features that allow individuals to be distinguished from one another. We tackle the challenging task of inverting the latent space of pre-trained face recognition models without full model access (i.e. black-box setting). A variety of methods have been proposed in literature for this task, but they have serious shortcomings such as a lack of realistic outputs and strong requirements for the data set and accessibility of the face recognition model. By analyzing the black-box inversion problem, we show that the conditional diffusion model loss naturally emerges and that we can effectively sample from the inverse distribution even without an identity-specific loss. Our method, named identity denoising diffusion probabilistic model (ID3PM), leverages the stochastic nature of the denoising diffusion process to produce high-quality, identity-preserving face images with various backgrounds, lighting, poses, and expressions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of identity preservation and diversity both qualitatively and quantitatively, and our method is the first black-box face recognition model inversion method that offers intuitive control over the generation process.",Yes

Moreover, it runs in real-time on CPU, which makes it an ideal choice for applications requiring low-latency interactions. Overall, our unified approach for facial capture, head pose and gaze estimation provides a robust solution for capturing facial expressions and visual focus, with huge potential in HCI and AR/VR applications. Notably, our approach is naturally integrable with Mocap-NETs for 3D human body and hands pose estimation, offering one of the few state-of-the-art unified approaches that enable holistic recovery of 3D information regarding human gaze, face, upper/lower body, hands, and feet.",No
iccvw_2023_336,A Gated Attention Transformer for Multi-Person Pose Tracking.,"Multi-person pose tracking is an important element for many applications and requires to estimate the human poses of all persons in a video and to track them over time. The association of poses across frames remains an open research problem, in particular for online tracking methods, due to motion blur, crowded scenes and occlusions. To tackle the association challenge, we propose a Gated Attention Transformer. The core aspect of our model is the gating mechanism that automatically adapts the impact of appearance embeddings and embeddings based on temporal pose similarity in the attention layers. In order to re-identify persons that have been occluded, we incorporate a pose-conditioned re-identification network that provides initial embeddings and allows to match persons even if the number of visible joints differ between frames. We further propose a matching layer based on gated attention for pose-to-track association and duplicate removal. We evaluate our approach on PoseTrack 2018 and PoseTrack21.",No
iccvw_2023_337,Occluded Gait Recognition via Silhouette Registration Guided by Automated Occlusion Degree Estimation.,"Gait recognition tasks often face significant difficulties caused by partial occlusions of the human body. To address this challenge, we propose a silhouette registration method based on flexible estimation of the spatial scale associated with the occluding elements. Existing appearance-based methods require prior knowledge about the spatial scale of the human body in relation to the input image, or a bounding box that includes the actual full body. In our method, the region corresponding to the silhouette of the body is estimated directly from visible body parts within the image. This estimate is then used to normalize and register the human body by adapting it to the scale of the occlusions. To reduce the occlusion difference between elements of a matching pair, which may lead to substantial intra-subject variation when the difference is large, we use a pairwise mask to extract common visible regions for subsequent feature learning and matching. Experiments on the synthetic occluded OU-MVLP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which successfully improves recognition performance when matching pairs present occlusion differences. We discuss specific characteristics of the proposed silhouette registration and pairwise masking methods with the aid of detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations, in the hope of providing useful insights for future research on this topic.",No

We show that diffusion models enhance the accuracy, robustness, and coherence of human pose estimations. We introduce DiffHPE, a novel strategy for harnessing diffusion models in 3D-HPE, and demonstrate its ability to refine standard supervised 3D-HPE. We also show how diffusion models lead to more robust estimations in the face of occlusions, and improve the time-coherence and the sagittal symmetry of predictions. Using the Human 3.6M dataset, we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority over existing models, even under adverse situations where the occlusion patterns in training do not match those in inference. Our findings indicate that while standalone diffusion models provide commendable performance, their accuracy is even better in combination with supervised models, opening exciting new avenues for 3D-HPE research.",No

iccvw_2023_342,Tracing the Influence of Predecessors on Trajectory Prediction.,"In real-world traffic scenarios, agents such as pedestrians and car drivers often observe neighboring agents who exhibit similar behavior as examples and then mimic their actions to some extent in their own behavior. This information can serve as prior knowledge for trajectory prediction, which is unfortunately largely overlooked in current trajectory prediction models. This paper introduces a novel Predecessor-and-Successor (PnS) method that incorporates a predecessor tracing module to model the influence of predecessors (identified from concurrent neighboring agents) on the successor (target agent) within the same scene. The method utilizes the moving patterns of these predecessors to guide the predictor in trajectory prediction. PnS effectively aligns the motion encodings of the successor with multiple potential predecessors in a probabilistic manner, facilitating the decoding process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PnS by integrating it into a graph-based predictor for pedestrian trajectory prediction on the ETH/UCY datasets, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we replace the HD map-based scene-context module with our PnS method in a transformer-based predictor for vehicle trajectory prediction on the nuScenes dataset, showing that the predictor maintains good prediction performance even without relying on any map information.",No
iccvw_2023_343,Traffic Mirror Detection and Annotation Methods from Street Images of Open Data for Preventing Accidents at Intersections by Alert.,"In recent years, research on autonomous driving has been actively pursued in the automotive industry. In Japan, a bill to revise the Road Traffic Act law regarding level 4 autonomous driving is passed in 2022, indicating a proactive approach toward autonomous driving. In light of these trends, improving safety during car travel has become an even more important challenge than before. Especially, intersections with poor visibility have been one of the major causes of traffic accidents, and improving safety at such intersections is an essential element in enhancing safety during car/bicycle travel. In this study, we aim to develop a system capable of identifying blind spots reflected in traffic mirrors by analyzing worldwide open data such as road images (e.g., Google Street View) and road information (e.g., OpenStreetMap). By Annotating the critical points from open data, the application could provide alerts to pedestrians and vehicles, enhancing safety in the vicinity of these blind spots. Specifically, we initially investigate the most effective deep learning model for detecting traffic mirrors. Additionally, we analyze the location information of traffic mirrors from geospatial data and road image data to construct a traffic mirror distribution map. Furthermore, we intend to equip bicycles with smartphones to track and detect the trajectories of pedestrians and vehicles reflected in these traffic mirrors.",No
iccvw_2023_344,"Efficient, Self-Supervised Human Pose Estimation with Inductive Prior Tuning.","The goal of 2D human pose estimation (HPE) is to localize anatomical landmarks, given an image of a person in a pose.

On the other hand, self-supervised methods re-frame the HPE task as a reconstruction problem, enabling them to leverage the vast amount of unlabeled visual data, though at the present cost of accuracy. In this work, we explore ways to improve self-supervised HPE. We (1) analyze the relationship between reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy, (2) develop a model pipeline that outperforms the baseline which inspired our work, using less than one-third the amount of training data, and (3) offer a new metric suitable for self-supervised settings that measures the consistency of predicted body part length proportions. We show that a combination of well-engineered reconstruction losses and inductive priors can help coordinate pose learning alongside reconstruction in a self-supervised paradigm.",No
iccvw_2023_345,Temporal DINO: A Self-supervised Video Strategy to Enhance Action Prediction.,"The emerging field of action prediction - the task of forecasting action in a video sequence - plays a vital role in various computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, activity analysis and human-computer interaction. Despite significant advancements, accurately predicting future actions remains a challenging problem due to high dimensionality, complex dynamics and uncertainties inherent in video data. Traditional supervised approaches require large amounts of labelled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This paper introduces a novel self-supervised video strategy for enhancing action prediction inspired by DINO (self-distillation with no labels). The approach, named Temporal-DINO, employs two models; a â€˜studentâ€™ processing past frames; and a â€˜teacherâ€™ processing both past and future frames, enabling a broader temporal context. During training, the teacher guides the student to learn future context by only observing past frames. The strategy is evaluated on ROAD dataset for the action prediction downstream task using 3D-ResNet, Transformer, and LSTM architectures. The experimental results showcase significant improvements in prediction performance across these architectures, with our method achieving an average enhancement of 9.9% Precision Points (PP), which highlights its effectiveness in enhancing the backbonesâ€™ capabilities of capturing long-term dependencies. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates efficiency in terms of the pretraining dataset size and the number of epochs required. This method overcomes limitations present in other approaches, including the consideration of various backbone architectures, addressing multiple prediction horizons, reducing reliance on hand-crafted augmentations, and streamlining the pretraining process into a single stage. These findings highlight the potential of our approach in diverse video-based tasks such as activity recognition, motion planning, and scene understanding. Code can be found at...",No
iccvw_2023_346,Progressive Feature Adjustment for Semi-supervised Learning from Pretrained Models.,"As an effective way to alleviate the burden of data annotation, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an attractive solution due to its ability to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to build a predictive model. While significant progress has been made recently, SSL algorithms are often evaluated and developed under the assumption that the network is randomly initialized. This is in sharp contrast to most vision recognition systems that are built from fine-tuning a pretrained network for better performance. While the marriage of SSL and a pretrained model seems to be straightforward, recent literature suggests that naively applying state-of-the-art SSL with a pretrained model fails to unleash the full potential of training data. In this paper, we postulate the underlying reason is that the pretrained feature representation could bring a bias inherited from the source data, and the bias tends to be magnified through the self-training process in a typical SSL algorithm. To overcome this issue, we propose to use pseudo-labels from the unlabelled data to update the feature extractor that is less sensitive to incorrect labels and only allow the classifier to be trained from the labeled data. More specifically, we progressively adjust the feature extractor to ensure its induced feature distribution maintains a good class separability even under strong input perturbation. Through extensive experimental studies, we show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over existing solutions.",No

iccvw_2023_350,Memory-augmented Variational Adaptation for Online Few-shot Segmentation.,"In this paper, we investigate online few-shot segmentation, which learns to make mask prediction for novel classes while observing samples sequentially. The main challenge in such an online scenario is the sample diversity in the sequence, resulting in models learned from previous samples that do not generalize well to future samples. To this end, we propose a memory-augmented variational adaptation network, which learns to adapt the model to each new sample that arrives sequentially. Specifically, we first introduce a contextual prototypical memory, which retains category knowledge from previous contextual information to facilitate the model adaptation to future samples. The adaptation to each new sample is then formulated as a variational Bayesian inference problem, which strives to generate sample-specific model parameters by conditioning the sample and the prototypical memory. Furthermore, we propose a feature customization module to learn sample-specific feature representation for better model adaptation to each sample in the sequence. With extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method effectively adapts to each sample from the online sample sequence, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance on both natural image and medical image datasets.",No
iccvw_2023_351,Instant Continual Learning of Neural Radiance Fields.,"Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have emerged as an effective method for novel-view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. However, conventional training methods require access to all training views during scene optimization. This assumption may be prohibitive in continual learning scenarios, where new data is acquired in a sequential manner and a continuous update of the NeRF is desired, as in automotive or remote sensing applications. When naively trained in such a continual setting, traditional scene representation frameworks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is corrupted after training on new data. Prior works in alleviating forgetting with NeRFs suffer from low reconstruction quality and high latency, making them impractical for real-world application. We propose a continual learning framework for training NeRFs that leverages replay-based methods combined with a hybrid explicitâ€“ implicit scene representation. Our method outperforms previous methods in reconstruction quality when trained in a continual setting, while having the additional benefit of being an order of magnitude faster.",No.
iccvw_2023_352,ScrollNet: Dynamic Weight Importance for Continual Learning.,"The principle underlying most existing continual learning (CL) methods is to prioritize stability by penalizing changes in parameters crucial to old tasks, while allowing for plasticity in other parameters. The importance of weights for each task can be determined either explicitly through learning a task-specific mask during training (e.g., parameter isolation-based approaches) or implicitly by introducing a regularization term (e.g., regularization-based approaches). However, all these methods assume that the importance of weights for each task is unknown prior to data exposure. In this paper, we propose ScrollNet as a scrolling neural network for continual learning. ScrollNet can be seen as a dynamic network that assigns the ranking of weight importance for each task before data exposure, thus achieving a more favorable stability-plasticity tradeoff during sequential task learning by reassigning this ranking for different tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that Scroll-Net can be combined with various CL methods, including regularization-based and replay-based approaches. Experimental results on CIFAR100 and TinyImagenet datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method.",No
iccvw_2023_353,Identification of Novel Classes for Improving Few-Shot Object Detection.,"Conventional training of deep neural networks requires a large number of the annotated image which is a laborious and time-consuming task, particularly for rare objects. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) methods offer a remedy by realizing robust object detection using only a few training samples per class [16], [37], [36], [8], [48], [15]. A challenge for FSOD is that instances from unlabeled novel classes that do not belong to the fixed set of training classes appear in the background. These objects behave similarly to label noise, leading to FSOD performance degradation. We develop a semi-supervised algorithm to detect and then utilize these unlabeled novel objects as positive samples during training to improve FSOD performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical ternary classification region proposal network (HTRPN) to localize the potential unlabeled novel objects and assign them new objectness labels. Our improved hierarchical sampling strategy for the region proposal network (RPN) also boosts the perception ability of the object detection model for large objects.

iccvw_2023_354,SAM-Adapter: Adapting Segment Anything in Underperformed Scenes.,"The emergence of large models, also known as foundation models, has brought significant advancements to AI research. One such model is Segment Anything (SAM), which is designed for image segmentation tasks. However, as with other foundation models, our experimental findings suggest that SAM may fail or perform poorly in certain segmentation tasks, such as shadow detection and camouflaged object detection (concealed object detection). This study first paves the way for applying the large pre-trained image segmentation model SAM to these downstream tasks, even in situations where SAM performs poorly. Rather than fine-tuning the SAM network, we propose SAM-Adapter, which incorporates domain-specific information or visual prompts into the segmentation network by using simple yet effective adapters. By integrating task-specific knowledge with general knowledge learnt by the large model, SAM-Adapter can significantly elevate the performance of SAM in challenging tasks as shown in extensive experiments. We can even outperform task-specific network models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the task we tested: camouflaged object detection, shadow detection. Our code of adapting SAM in downstream applications have been released publicly at https://github.com/tianrun-chen/SAM-Adapter-PyTorch/ and has benefited many researchers.

iccvw_2023_355,Experience Replay as an Effective Strategy for Optimizing Decentralized Federated Learning.,"Federated and continual learning are training paradigms addressing data distribution shift in space and time. More specifically, federated learning tackles non-i.i.d data in space as information is distributed in multiple nodes, while continual learning faces with temporal aspect of training as it deals with continuous streams of data. Distribution shifts over space and time is what it happens in real federated learning scenarios that show multiple challenges. First, the federated model needs to learn sequentially while retaining knowledge from the past training rounds. Second, the model has also to deal with concept drift from the distributed data distributions. To address these complexities, we attempt to combine continual and federated learning strategies by proposing a solution inspired by experience replay and generative adversarial concepts for supporting decentralized distributed training. In particular, our approach relies on using limited memory buffers of synthetic privacy-preserving samples and interleaving training on local data and on buffer data. By translating the CL formulation into the task of integrating distributed knowledge with local knowledge, our method enables models to effectively integrate learned representation from local nodes, providing models the capability to generalize across multiple datasets.We test our integrated strategy on two realistic medical image analysis tasks â€” tuberculosis and melanoma classification â€” using multiple datasets in order to simulate realistic non-i.i.d. medical data scenarios.

iccvw_2023_356,Clustering-based Domain-Incremental Learning.,"We consider the problem of learning multiple tasks in a continual learning setting in which data from different tasks is presented to the learner in a streaming fashion. A key challenge in this setting is the so-called ""catastrophic forgetting problem"", in which the performance of the learner in an ""old task"" decreases when subsequently trained on a ""new task"". Existing continual learning methods, such as Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM) and Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD), address catastrophic forgetting by minimizing the loss for the current task without increasing the loss for previous tasks. However, these methods assume the learner knows when the task changes, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we alleviate the need to provide the algorithm with information about task changes by using an online clustering-based approach on a dynamically updated finite pool of samples or gradients. We thereby successfully counteract catastrophic forgetting in one of the hardest settings, namely: domain-incremental learning, a setting for which the problem was previously unsolved. We showcase the benefits of our approach by applying these ideas to projection-based methods, such as A-GEM and OGD, which lead to task-agnostic versions of them. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its promising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",No
iccvw_2023_357,Multimodal Parameter-Efficient Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning.,"Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) is a challenging continual learning task, where limited training examples are available during several learning sessions. To succeed in this task, it is necessary to avoid over-fitting new classes caused by biased distributions in the few-shot training sets. The general approach to address this issue involves enhancing the representational capability of a predefined backbone architecture by adding special modules for backward compatibility with older classes. However, this approach has not yet solved the dilemma of ensuring high classification accuracy over time while reducing the gap between the performance obtained on larger training sets and the smaller ones. In this work, we propose an alternative approach called Continual Parameter-Efficient CLIP (CPE-CLIP) to reduce the loss of information between different learning sessions. Instead of adapting additional modules to address information loss, we leverage the vast knowledge acquired by CLIP in large-scale pre-training and its effectiveness in generalizing to new concepts. Our approach is multimodal and parameter-efficient, relying on learnable prompts for both the language and vision encoders to enable transfer learning across sessions. We also introduce prompt regularization to improve performance and prevent forgetting. Our experimental results demonstrate that CPE-CLIP significantly improves FSCIL performance compared to state-of-the-art proposals while also drastically reducing the number of learnable parameters and training costs.",No
iccvw_2023_358,Multi-Task Hypergraphs for Semi-supervised Learning using Earth Observations.,"There are many ways of interpreting the world and they are highly interdependent. We exploit such complex dependencies and introduce a powerful multi-task hypergraph, in which every node is a task and different paths through the hypergraph reaching a given task become unsupervised teachers, by forming ensembles that learn to generate reliable pseudolabels for that task. Each hyperedge is part of an ensemble teacher for a given task and it is also a student of the self-supervised hypergraph system. We apply our model to one of the most important problems of our times, that of Earth Observation, which is highly multi-task and it often suffers from missing ground-truth data. By performing extensive experiments on the NASA NEO Dataset, spanning a period of 22 years, we demonstrate the value of our multitask semi-supervised approach, by consistent improvements over strong baselines and recent work. We also show that the hypergraph can adapt unsupervised to gradual data distribution shifts and reliably recover, through its multi-task self-supervision process, the missing data for several observational layers for up to seven years.",No
iccvw_2023_359,Multi-Task Consistency for Active Learning.,"Learning-based solutions for vision tasks require a large amount of labeled training data to ensure their performance and reliability. In single-task vision-based settings, inconsistency-based active learning has proven to be effective in selecting informative samples for annotation. However, there is a lack of research exploiting the inconsistency between multiple tasks in multi-task networks. To address this gap, we propose a novel multi-task active learning strategy for two coupled vision tasks: object detection and semantic segmentation. Our approach leverages the inconsistency between them to identify informative samples across both tasks. We propose three constraints that specify how the tasks are coupled and introduce a method for determining the pixels belonging to the object detected by a bounding box, to later quantify the constraints as inconsistency scores. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we establish multiple baselines for multi-task active learning and introduce a new metric, mean Detection Segmentation Quality (mDSQ), tailored for the multi-task active learning comparison that addresses the performance of both tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuImages and A9 datasets, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.4% mDSQ on nuImages. Our approach achieves 95% of the fully-trained performance using only 67% of the available data, corresponding to 20% fewer labels compared to random selection and 5% fewer labels compared to state-of-the-art selection strategy.

In this work, following the recent breakthrough in text-to-image generative models and their wide distribution, we propose the use of a pretrained Stable Diffusion model as a source of additional data for class-incremental learning. Compared to competitive methods that rely on external, often unlabeled, datasets of real images, our approach can generate synthetic samples belonging to the same classes as the previously encountered images. This allows us to use those additional data samples not only in the distillation loss but also for replay in the classification loss. Experiments on the competitive benchmarks CIFAR100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet demonstrate how this new approach can be used to further improve the performance of state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning on large scale datasets.",No
iccvw_2023_361,Flashback for Continual Learning.,"To strike a delicate balance between model stability and plasticity of continual learning, previous approaches have adopted strategies to guide model updates on new data to preserve old knowledge while implicitly absorbing new information through task objective function (e.g. classification loss). However, our goal is to achieve this balance more explicitly, proposing a bi-directional regularization that guides the model in preserving existing knowledge and actively absorbing new knowledge. To address this, we propose the Flashback Learning (FL) algorithm, a two-stage training approach that seamlessly integrates with diverse methods from different continual learning categories. FL creates two knowledge bases; one with high plasticity to control learning and one conservative to prevent forgetting, then it guides the model update using these two knowledge bases. FL significantly improves baseline methods on common image classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet in various settings.",No
iccvw_2023_362,Continual Evidential Deep Learning for Out-of-Distribution Detection.,"Uncertainty-based deep learning models have attracted a great deal of interest for their ability to provide accurate and reliable predictions. Evidential deep learning stands out achieving remarkable performance in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data with a single deterministic neural network. Motivated by this fact, in this paper we propose the integration of an evidential deep learning method into a continual learning framework in order to perform simultaneously incremental object classification and OOD detection. Moreover, we analyze the ability of vacuity and dissonance to differentiate between in-distribution data belonging to old classes and OOD data. The proposed method 1, called CEDL, is evaluated on CIFAR-100 considering two settings consisting of 5 and 10 tasks, respectively. From the obtained results, we could appreciate that the proposed method, in addition to provide comparable results in object classification with respect to the baseline, largely outperforms OOD detection compared to several posthoc methods on three evaluation metrics: AUROC, AUPR and FPR95.",No
iccvw_2023_363,Continual Learning with Deep Streaming Regularized Discriminant Analysis.,"Continual learning is increasingly sought after in real-world machine learning applications, as it enables learning in a more human-like manner. Conventional machine learning approaches fail to achieve this, as incrementally updating the model with non-identically distributed data leads to catastrophic forgetting, where existing representations are overwritten. Although traditional continual learning methods have mostly focused on batch learning, which involves learning from large collections of labeled data sequentially, this approach is not well-suited for real-world applications where we would like new data to be integrated directly. This necessitates a paradigm shift towards streaming learning. In this paper, we propose1 a streaming version of regularized discriminant analysis as a solution to this challenge. We combine our algorithm with a convolutional neural network and demonstrate that it outperforms both batch learning and existing streaming learning algorithms on the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset.",No
iccvw_2023_364,FedRCIL: Federated Knowledge Distillation for Representation based Contrastive Incremental Learning.,"The present work proposes a holistic approach to address catastrophic forgetting in the field of computer vision during the process of incremental learning. More specifically, it suggests a series of steps for effective learning of models in distributed environments, based on extracting meaningful representations, modeling them into actual knowledge, and transferring it through a continual distillation mechanism. Additionally, it introduces a federated learning algorithm tailored to the problem, eliminating the need for central model transfer, by proposing an approach based on multi-scale representation learning, coupled with a Knowledge Distillation technique. Finally, inspired by the current trend, it modifies a contrastive learning technique combining existing knowledge with previous states, aiming to preserve previously learned knowledge while incorporating new knowledge. Thorough experimentation has been conducted to provide a comprehensive analysis of the issue at hand, highlighting the great potential of the proposed method, achieving great results in a federated environment with reduced communication cost and a robust performance within highly distributed incremental scenarios.",No
iccvw_2023_365,SATHUR: Self Augmenting Task Hallucinal Unified Representation for Generalized Class Incremental Learning.,"Class Incremental Learning (CIL) is inspired by the human ability to learn new classes without forgetting previous ones. CIL becomes more challenging in real-world scenarios when the samples in each incremental step are imbalanced. This creates another branch of problem, called Generalized Class Incremental Learning (GCIL) where each incremental step is structured more realistically. Grow When Required (GWR) network, a type of Self-Organizing Map (SOM), dynamically creates and removes nodes and edges for adaptive learning. GWR performs incremental learning from feature vectors extracted by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which acts as a feature extractor. The inherent ability of GWR to form distinct clusters, each corresponding to a class in the feature vector space, regardless of the order of samples or class imbalances, is well suited to achieving GCIL. To enhance GWR's classification performance, a high-quality feature extractor is required. However, when the convolutional layers are adapted at each incremental step, the GWR nodes corresponding to prior knowledge are subjected to near-invalidation. This work introduces the Self Augmenting Task Hallucinal Unified Representation (SATHUR), which re-initializes the GWR network at each incremental step, aligning it with the incrementally updated feature extractor. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art GCIL methods on CIFAR-100 and CORe50 datasets.",No
iccvw_2023_366,Memory Population in Continual Learning via Outlier Elimination.,"Catastrophic forgetting, the phenomenon of forgetting previously learned tasks when learning a new one, is a major hurdle in developing continual learning algorithms. A popular method to alleviate forgetting is to use a memory buffer, which stores a subset of previously learned task examples for use during training on new tasks. The de facto method of filling memory is by randomly selecting previous examples. However, this process could introduce outliers or noisy samples that could hurt the generalization of the model. This paper introduces Memory Outlier Elimination (MOE), a method for identifying and eliminating outliers in the memory buffer by choosing samples from label-homogeneous subpopulations. We show that a space with a high homogeneity is related to a feature space that is more representative of the class distribution. In practice, MOE removes a sample if it is surrounded by samples from different labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MOE on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CORe50, outperforming previous well-known memory population methods.",No
iccvw_2023_367,AR-TTA: A Simple Method for Real-World Continual Test-Time Adaptation.,"Test-time adaptation is a promising research direction that allows the source model to adapt itself to changes in data distribution without any supervision. Yet, current methods are usually evaluated on benchmarks that are only a simplification of real-world scenarios. Hence, we propose to validate test-time adaptation methods using the recently introduced datasets for autonomous driving, namely CLAD-C and SHIFT. We observe that current test-time adaptation methods struggle to effectively handle varying degrees of domain shift, often resulting in degraded performance that falls below that of the source model. We noticed that the root of the problem lies in the inability to preserve the knowledge of the source model and adapt to dynamically changing, temporally correlated data streams. Therefore, we enhance well-established self-training framework by incorporating a small memory buffer to increase model stability and at the same time perform dynamic adaptation based on the intensity of domain shift. The proposed method, named AR-TTA, outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and more real-world benchmarks and shows robustness across a variety of TTA scenarios.",No
iccvw_2023_368,Looking through the past: better knowledge retention for generative replay in continual learning.,"In this work, we improve the generative replay in a continual learning setting. We notice that in VAE-based generative replay, the generated features are quite far from the original ones when mapped to the latent space. Therefore, we propose modifications that allow the model to learn and generate complex data. More specifically, we incorporate the distillation in latent space between the current and previous models to reduce feature drift. Additionally, a latent matching for the reconstruction and original data is proposed to improve generated features alignment. Further, based on the observation that the reconstructions are better for preserving knowledge, we add the cycling of generations through the previously trained model to make them closer to the original data. Our method outperforms other generative replay methods in various scenarios.",No
iccvw_2023_369,Decision Boundary Optimization for Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning.,"Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is gaining prominence in real-world machine learning applications, including image classification and face recognition. Existing methods often employ parameter freezing for the backbone and classify based on metric learning. However, these methods suffer from two significant problems. Firstly, training the backbone solely on base classes limits its performance on novel classes due to information loss. Secondly, conventional metric-based strategies for prototype generation tend to introduce confusion in decision boundaries during few-shot tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Decision Boundary Optimization Network (DBONet) for few-shot class-incremental learning. To tackle the first issue, DBONet incorporates an augmentation feature extractor along with a corresponding loss function. This augmentation feature extractor combines samples from different categories to capture richer features. For the second issue, we leverage limited sample representativeness information by introducing the Prototype Generation Module (PGM) into DBONet, enabling the generation of more representative prototypes. The prototypes produced by PGM significantly contribute to the accurate delineation of decision boundaries. Furthermore, we exploit intra-class information to enhance classification precision. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200 datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art results.",No.
iccvw_2023_370,Adapt Your Teacher: Improving Knowledge Distillation for Exemplar-free Continual Learning.,"In this work, we investigate exemplar-free class incremental learning (CIL) with knowledge distillation (KD) as a regularization strategy, aiming to prevent forgetting. KD-based methods are successfully used in CIL, but they often struggle to regularize the model without access to exemplars of the training data from previous tasks. Our analysis reveals that this issue originates from substantial representation shifts in the teacher network when dealing with out-of-distribution data. This causes large errors in the KD loss component, leading to performance degradation in CIL. Inspired by recent test-time adaptation methods, we introduce Teacher Adaptation (TA), a method that concurrently updates the teacher and the main model during incremental training. Our method seamlessly integrates with KD-based CIL approaches and allows for consistent enhancement of their performance across multiple exemplar-free CIL benchmarks.",No
iccvw_2023_371,A Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation on Online Continual Learning.,"Online continual learning aims to get closer to a live learning experience by learning directly on a stream of data with temporally shifting distribution and by storing a minimum amount of data from that stream. In this empirical evaluation, we evaluate various methods from the literature that tackle online continual learning. More specifically, we focus on the class-incremental setting in the context of image classification, where the learner must learn new classes incrementally from a stream of data. We compare these methods on the Split-CIFAR100 and Split-TinyImagenet benchmarks, and measure their average accuracy, forgetting, stability, and quality of the representations, to evaluate various aspects of the algorithm at the end but also during the whole training period. We find that most methods suffer from stability and underfitting issues. However, the learned representations are comparable to i.i.d. training under the same computational budget. No clear winner emerges from the results and basic experience replay, when properly tuned and implemented, is a very strong baseline. We release our modular and extensible codebase at https://github.com/AlbinSou/ocl_survey based on the avalanche framework to reproduce our results and encourage future research.",No
iccvw_2023_372,TKIL: Tangent Kernel Optimization for Class Balanced Incremental Learning.,"When learning multiple tasks in a sequence, deep neural networks tend to loose accuracy on tasks learned in the past while gaining accuracy on the current task. This phenomenon is called catastrophic forgetting. Memory-based Class Incremental Learning (CIL) methods address this problem by re-learning exemplars retained in the memory from previous tasks. However, due to data imbalances between the training data for the current task and the limited exemplars from previous tasks, existing methods struggle to balance the accuracy across all seen tasks. Here, we propose to address data imbalance and in addition to a generic model to learn a set of task-specific parameters. In particular, we propose a novel methodology of Tangent Kernel for Incremental Learning (TKIL) that seeks an equilibrium between current and previous representations. Specifically, TKIL achieves such equilibrium by tuning different task-specific parameters for different tasks with a new Gradient Tangent Kernel (GTK) loss. Therefore, when representing previous tasks, task-specific models are not impacted by the samples of the current task and are able to retain learned representations. As a result, TKIL equally considers the contribution from all task models. The generalized parameters that TKIL obtains allow it to automatically identify which task is being considered and to adapt to it during inference. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmark datasets with ten incremental learning settings show that TKIL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving 9.4% boost on CIFAR-100 with 25 incremental stages.",No
iccvw_2023_373,Improving Replay Sample Selection and Storage for Less Forgetting in Continual Learning.,"Continual learning seeks to enable deep learners to train on a series of tasks of unknown length without suffering from the catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks. One effective solution is replay, which involves storing few previous experiences in memory and replaying them when learning the current task. However, there is still room for improvement when it comes to selecting the most informative samples for storage and determining the optimal number of samples to be stored. This study aims to address these issues with a novel comparison of the commonly used reservoir sampling to various alternative population strategies and providing a novel detailed analysis of how to find the optimal number of stored samples.",No
iccvw_2023_374,Selective Freezing for Efficient Continual Learning.,"This paper aims to tackle the challenges of continual learning, where sequential learning from a stream of tasks can lead to catastrophic forgetting. Simultaneously, it addresses the need to reduce the computational demands of large-scale deep learning models to mitigate their environmental impact. To achieve this twofold objective, we propose a method that combines selective layer freezing with fast adaptation in a continual learning context. We begin by conducting an extensive analysis of layer freezing in continual learning, revealing that certain configurations allow for freezing a substantial portion of the model without significant accuracy degradation. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel approach that optimizes plasticity on new tasks while preserving stability on previous tasks by dynamically identifying a subset of layers to freeze during training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving competitive performance with manually-tuned freezing strategies. Moreover, we quantitatively estimate the reduction in computation and energy requirements achieved through our freezing strategy by considering the number of parameters and updates required for model training.",No
iccvw_2023_375,Confusion Mixup Regularized Multimodal Fusion Network for Continual Egocentric Activity Recognition.,"Continual egocentric activity recognition aims to understand diverse first-person activities from the multimodal data of a wearable device captured in streaming environments, which is an emerging and challenging task. Existing continual learning methods ignore the dynamic change of multiple modalitiesâ€™ correlation and hardly learn discriminative representations for the sequentially isolated activity classes from different stages. In this paper, we propose a Confusion Mixup Regularized Multimodal Fusion Network (CMR-MFN) to address this issue. Firstly, CMR-MFN is composed of a ternary-modality-input dynamic expansion architecture, which progressively grows additional branches for in-stage class recognition. Each input owns a frozen modality-specific backbone to avoid forgetting caused by parameter shifts. Secondly, CMR-MFN captures the dynamics of multimodal inputs via learnable self-attention layers. We augment unknown classes by linearly mixing up the samples from two known classes and assigning a biased weight to one of them, which makes the unknown class samples confusing toward the known class with a higher weight. By learning from the current and augmented training data together, we regularize the multimodal fusion representation to distinguish the in-stage classes from their confusing samples of unknown classes, which implicitly pushes the out-stage classesâ€™ samples far from the in-stage classesâ€™ ones when they are similar to each other. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multimodal continual egocentric activity recognition. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hanna-W/CMR-MFN.",No
iccvw_2023_376,Margin Contrastive Learning with Learnable-Vector for Continual Learning.,"In continual learning, there is a serious problem ""catastrophic forgetting"", in which previously acquired knowledge is forgotten when a new task is learned. Various methods have been proposed to solve this problem. Among them, Replay methods, which store a portion of the past training data and regenerate it for later tasks, have shown excellent performance. In this paper, we propose a new online continuous learning method that adds a representative vector for each class and a margin for similarity computation to the conventional method, Supervised Contrastive Replay (SCR). Our method aims to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting caused by class imbalance by using learnable vectors of each class and adding a margin to the calculation of similarity. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets confirm that our method outperformed conventional methods.",No
iccvw_2023_377,A Simple Signal for Domain Shift.,"Test time domain adaptation has come to the forefront as a challenging scenario in recent times. Although single domain test-time adaptation has been well studied and shown impressive performance, this can be limiting when the model is deployed in a dynamic test environment. We explore this continual domain test time adaptation problem here. Specifically, we question if we can translate the effectiveness of single domain adaptation methods to continuous test-time adaptation scenario. We take a step towards bridging the gap between these two settings by proposing a domain shift detection mechanism and hence allowing us to employ the current test-time adaptation methods even in a continual setting. We propose to use the given source domain trained model to continually measure the similarity between the feature representations of the consecutive batches. A domain shift is detected when this measure crosses a certain threshold, which we use as a trigger to reset the model back to source and continue test-time adaptation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments across datasets, batch sizes and different single domain test-time adaptation baselines.",No
iccvw_2023_378,On the Effectiveness of LayerNorm Tuning for Continual Learning in Vision Transformers.,"State-of-the-art rehearsal-free continual learning methods exploit the peculiarities of Vision Transformers to learn task-specific prompts, drastically reducing catastrophic forgetting. However, there is a tradeoff between the number of learned parameters and the performance, making such models computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to reduce this cost while maintaining competitive performance. We achieve this by revisiting and extending a simple transfer learning idea: learning task-specific normalization layers. Specifically, we tune the scale and bias parameters of LayerNorm for each continual learning task, selecting them at inference time based on the similarity between task-specific keys and the output of the pre-trained model. To make the classifier robust to incorrect selection of parameters during inference, we introduce a two-stage training procedure, where we first optimize the task-specific parameters and then train the classifier with the same selection procedure of the inference time. Experiments on ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 show that our method achieves results that are either superior or on par with the state of the art while being computationally cheaper.1",No
iccvw_2023_379,Comparative Study of Natural Replay and Experience Replay in Online Object Detection.,"Online Object Detection (OOD) algorithms play a crucial role in dynamic and real-world computer vision applications. In these scenarios, models are trained on a data stream where old class samples are revisited, a phenomenon known as Natural Replay (NR). During training, NR occurs unevenly across object categories, leading to evaluation metrics biased towards the most frequently revisited classes. Existing benchmarks lack proper quantification of NR and depict short-term training scenarios on a single domain. As a result, evaluating generalization capabilities and forgetting rates of models become challenging in OOD. In this paper, we address the challenges surrounding the evaluation of OOD models by proposing two key contributions. Firstly, we define a metric to quantify NR in an OOD scenario and show how NR is related to class specific forgetting. Secondly, we introduce a novel benchmark, EgOAK, which introduces a long-term training scenario that involves frequent domain shifts. It allows the evaluation of modelsâ€™ generalization capabilities and forgetting of knowledge on past domains. Our results in this OOD setting reveal that Experience Replay, a memory-based method, is particularly effective for better generalization to new domains and for preserving past knowledge. Leveraging replay from memory helps to address the low natural replay rate for rarely revisited classes, resulting in improved adaptability and reliability of models in dynamic environments.",No
iccvw_2023_380,Unseen And Adverse Outdoor Scenes Recognition Through Event-based Captions.,"This paper presents EventCAP, i.e., event-based captions, for refined and enriched qualitative and quantitative captions by Deep Learning (DL) models and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with different tasks in a complementary manner. Indoor and outdoor images are used for object recognition and captioning. However, outdoor images in events change in wide ranges due to natural phenomena, i.e., weather changes. Such dynamical changes may degrade segmentation by illumination and object shape changes. This increases unseen objects and scenes under such adverse conditions. On the other hand, single state-of-art (SOTA) DLs and VLMs work with single or limited tasks, Therefore, this paper proposes EventCAP with captions with physical scales and objectsâ€™ surface properties. Moreover, an iterative VQA model is proposed to refine in-complete segmented images with the prompts. A higher se-mantic level in captions for real-world scene descriptions is experimentally shown compared to SOTA VLMs.",No
iccvw_2023_381,Adversarial Examples with Specular Highlights.,"We introduce specular highlight as a natural adversary and examine how deep neural network classifiers can get affected by them, resulting in a reduction in their prediction performance. We also curate two separate datasets, ImageNet-AH with artificially generated Gaussian specular highlights and ImageNet-PT by flashing natural specular highlights on printed images, both demonstrating significant degradations in the performance of the classifiers. We note around 20% drop in the model prediction accuracy with artificial specular highlights and around 35% accuracy drop in torch-highlighted printed images. These drops indeed question the robustness and reliability of modern-day image classifiers. We also find that finetuning these classifiers with specular images does not improve the prediction performance enough. To understand the reason, we finally do an activation mapping analysis and examine the network attention areas in images with and without highlights. We find that specular highlights shift the attention of models which makes fine-tuning ineffective, eventually broadly leading to performance drops.",Yes
iccvw_2023_382,IPCert: Provably Robust Intellectual Property Protection for Machine Learning.,"Watermarking and fingerprinting are two popular methods to protect intellectual property (IP) of a model. In particular, a model owner can use them to detect whether a given model is a stolen version of its model. Robustness against perturbation added to a model is a key desired property for IP protection methods. In this work, we first show that existing IP protection methods are not robust against model perturbations in the worst-case scenarios as previously thought. Second, we propose a randomized smoothing based framework that can turn a watermarking/fingerprinting method to be provably robust against model perturbations. However, a straightforward application of randomized smoothing achieves suboptimal provable robustness. To address the challenge, we propose optimization strategies to enhance provable robustness. We evaluate our framework on multiple datasets to show its provable robustness.",Yes
iccvw_2023_383,Fair Robust Active Learning by Joint Inconsistency.,"We introduce a new learning framework, Fair Robust Active Learning (FRAL), generalizing conventional active learning to fair and adversarial robust scenarios. This framework enables us to achieve fair-performance and fairrobustness with limited labeled data, which is essential for various annotation-expensive visual applications with safety-critical needs. However, existing fairness-aware data selection strategies face two challenges when applied to the FRAL framework: they are either ineffective under severe data imbalance or inefficient due to huge computations of adversarial training. To address these issues, we develop a novel Joint INconsistency (JIN) method that exploits prediction inconsistencies between benign and adversarial inputs and between standard and robust models. By leveraging these two types of easy-to-compute inconsistencies simultaneously, JIN can identify valuable samples that contribute more to fairness gains and class imbalance mitigation in both standard and adversarial robust settings. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and sensitive groups demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing active data selection baselines, achieving fair-performance and fairrobustness under white-box PGD attacks.",Yes
iccvw_2023_384,Classification robustness to common optical aberrations.,"Computer vision using deep neural networks (DNNs) has brought about seminal changes in people's lives. Applications range from automotive, face recognition in the security industry, to industrial process monitoring. In some cases, DNNs infer even in safety-critical situations. Therefore, for practical applications, DNNs have to behave in a robust way to disturbances such as noise, pixelation, or blur. Blur directly impacts the performance of DNNs, which are often approximated as a disk-shaped kernel to model defocus. However, optics suggests that there are different kernel shapes depending on wavelength and location caused by optical aberrations. In practice, as the optical quality of a lens decreases, such aberrations increase. This paper proposes OpticsBench, a benchmark for investigating robustness to realistic, practically relevant optical blur effects. Each corruption represents an optical aberration (coma, astigmatism, spherical, trefoil) derived from Zernike Polynomials. Experiments on ImageNet show that for a variety of different pre-trained DNNs, the performance varies strongly compared to disk-shaped kernels, indicating the necessity of considering realistic image degradations. In addition, we show on ImageNet-100 with OpticsAugment that robustness can be increased by using optical kernels as data augmentation. Compared to a conventionally trained ResNeXt50, training with OpticsAugment achieves an average performance gain of 21.7% points on OpticsBench and 6.8% points on 2D common corruptions.",No
iccvw_2023_385,Defense-Prefix for Preventing Typographic Attacks on CLIP.,"Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) have exhibited revolutionary improvements in various vision-language tasks. In VLP, some adversarial attacks fool a model into false or absurd classifications. Previous studies addressed these attacks by fine-tuning the model or changing its architecture. However, these methods risk losing the original model's performance and are difficult to apply to downstream tasks. In particular, their applicability to other tasks has not been considered. In this study, we addressed the reduction of the impact of typographic attacks on CLIP without changing the model parameters. To achieve this, we expand the idea of ""class-prefix learning"" and introduce our simple yet effective method: Defense-Prefix (DP), which inserts the DP token before a class name to make words ""robust"" against typographic attacks. Our method can be easily applied to downstream tasks, such as object detection, because the proposed method is independent of the model parameters. Our method significantly improves the accuracy of classification tasks for typographic attack datasets, while maintaining the zero-shot capabilities of the model. In addition, we leverage our proposed method for object detection, demonstrating its high applicability and effectiveness. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/azuma164/Defense-Prefix.",Yes
iccvw_2023_386,Semantically Enhanced Scene Captions with Physical and Weather Condition Changes.,"Vision-Language models (VLMs), i.e., image-text pairs of CLIP, have boosted image-based Deep Learning (DL). Moreover, Visual-Question-Answer (VQA) tools and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation provide us with more detailed scene descriptions, i.e., qualitative texts, in captions. Images from surveillance, auto-drive, and mobile phone cameras have been used with segmentation and captions. However, unlike indoor scenes, outdoor scenes with uncontrolled illumination and noise can degrade the accuracy of segmented objects. Moreover, unpredictable events such as natural phenomena and accidents can cause dynamic and adverse scene changes over time. This greatly increases unseen objects due to sudden changes. Therefore, only a single state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLM and DL model cannot sufficiently generate and enhance captions. Even one time VQA is limited to generate a good answer. This paper proposes RoadCAP for refined and enriched qualitative and quantitative captions by DL models and VLMs with different tasks in a complementary manner. In particular, 2D-Contrastive Physical-Scale Pretraining (CPP) is also proposed for captions with physical scales. An iterative VQA model is proposed to further refine incomplete segmented images with the prompts. Experimental results outperform SOTA DL models and VLMs using images with adverse conditions. A higher semantic level in captions for real-world scene descriptions is shown as compared with SOTA VLMs.",No
iccvw_2023_387,PRAT: PRofiling Adversarial aTtacks.,"Intrinsic susceptibility of deep learning to adversarial examples has led to a plethora of attack techniques with a broad common objective of fooling deep models. However, we find slight compositional differences between the algorithms achieving this objective. These differences leave traces that provide important clues for attacker profiling in real-life scenarios. Inspired by this, we introduce a novel problem of â€˜PRofiling Adversarial aTtacksâ€™ (PRAT). Given an adversarial example, the objective of PRAT is to identify the attack used to generate it. Under this perspective, we can systematically group existing attacks into different families, leading to the sub-problem of attack family identification, which we also study. To enable PRAT analysis, we introduce a large â€˜Adversarial Identification Datasetâ€™ (AID), comprising over 180k adversarial samples generated with 13 popular attacks for image specific/agnostic white/black box setups. We use AID to devise a novel framework for the PRAT objective. Our framework utilizes a Transformer based Global-LOcal Feature (GLOF) module to extract an approximate signature of the adversarial attack, which in turn is used for the identification of the attack. Using AID and our framework, we provide multiple interesting benchmark results for the PRAT problem. The dataset and the code are available at https://github.com/rahulambati/PRAT",Yes
iccvw_2023_388,On the Adversarial Robustness of Multi-Modal Foundation Models.,"Multi-modal foundation models combining vision and language models such as Flamingo or GPT-4 have recently gained enormous interest. Alignment of foundation models is used to prevent models from providing toxic or harmful output. While malicious users have successfully tried to jailbreak foundation models, an equally important question is if honest users could be harmed by malicious third-party content. In this paper we show that imperceivable attacks on images

Note: This paper contains fake information to illustrate the outcome of our attacks. It does not reflect the opinion of the authors.",Yes
iccvw_2023_389,Black-Box Attacks on Image Activity Prediction and its Natural Language Explanations.,"Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim to describe the decision process of deep neural networks. Early XAI methods produced visual explanations, whereas more recent techniques generate multimodal explanations that include textual information and visual representations. Visual XAI methods have been shown to be vulnerable to white-box and gray-box adversarial attacks, with an attacker having full or partial knowledge of and access to the target system. As the vulnerabilities of multimodal XAI models have not been examined, in this paper we assess for the first time the robustness to black-box attacks of the natural language explanations generated by a self-rationalizing image-based activity recognition model. We generate unrestricted, spatially variant perturbations that disrupt the association between the predictions and the corresponding explanations to mislead the model into generating unfaithful explanations. We show that we can create adversarial images that manipulate the explanations of an activity recognition model by having access only to its final output.",Yes
iccvw_2023_390,OMG-Attack: Self-Supervised On-Manifold Generation of Transferable Evasion Attacks.,"Evasion Attacks (EA) are used to test the robustness of trained neural networks by distorting input data to misguide the model into incorrect classifications. Creating these attacks is a challenging task, especially with the ever increasing complexity of models and datasets. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised, computationally economical method for generating adversarial examples, designed for the unseen black-box setting. Adapting techniques from representation learning, our method generates on-manifold EAs that are encouraged to resemble the data distribution. These attacks are comparable in effectiveness compared to the state-of-the-art when attacking the model trained on, but are significantly more effective when attacking unseen models, as the attacks are more related to the data rather than the model itself. Our experiments consistently demonstrate the method is effective across various models, unseen data categories, and even defended models, suggesting a significant role for on-manifold EAs when targeting unseen models.",Yes
iccvw_2023_391,On the unreasonable vulnerability of transformers for image restoration - and an easy fix.,"Following their success in visual recognition tasks, Vision Transformers(ViTs) are being increasingly employed for image restoration. As a few recent works claim that ViTs for image classification also have better robustness properties, we investigate whether the improved adversarial robustness of ViTs extends to image restoration. We consider the recently proposed Restormer model, as well as NAFNet and the ""Baseline network"" which are both simplified versions of a Restormer. We use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and CosPGD for our robustness evaluation. Our experiments are performed on real-world images from the GoPro dataset for image deblurring. Our analysis indicates that contrary to as advocated by ViTs in image classification works, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. We attempt to find an easy fix and improve their robustness through adversarial training. While this yields a significant increase in robustness for Restormer, results on other networks are less promising. Interestingly, we find that the design choices in NAFNet and Baselines, which were based on iid performance, and not on robust generalization, seem to be at odds with the model robustness.",Yes

These data-driven models can learn to synthesize high-quality images from sparse 2D observations, enabling realistic and interactive scene reconstructions. However, the growing usage of NeRFs in critical applications such as augmented reality, robotics, and virtual environments could be threatened by adversarial attacks.In this paper we present how generalizable NeRFs can be attacked by both low-intensity adversarial attacks and adversarial patches, where the later could be robust enough to be used in real world applications. We also demonstrate targeted attacks, where a specific, predefined output scene is generated by these attack with success.",Yes
iccvw_2023_393,Guarding the Guardians: Automated Analysis of Online Child Sexual Abuse.,"Online violence against children has increased globally recently, demanding urgent attention. Competent authorities manually analyze abuse complaints to comprehend crime dynamics and identify patterns. However, the manual analysis of these complaints presents a challenge because it exposes analysts to harmful content during the review process. Given these challenges, we present a novel solution, an automated tool designed to analyze childrenâ€™s sexual abuse reports comprehensively. By automating the analysis process, our tool significantly reduces the risk of exposure to harmful content by categorizing the reports on three dimensions: Subject, Degree of Criminality, and Damage. Furthermore, leveraging our multidisciplinary teamâ€™s expertise, we introduce a novel approach to annotate the collected data, enabling a more in-depth analysis of the reports. This approach improves the comprehension of fundamental patterns and trends, enabling law enforcement agencies and policymakers to create focused strategies in the fight against childrenâ€™s violence.",No
iccvw_2023_394,Rapid Flood Inundation Forecast Using Fourier Neural Operator.,"Flood inundation forecast provides critical information for emergency planning before and during flood events. Real time flood inundation forecast tools are still lacking. High-resolution hydrodynamic modeling has become more accessible in recent years, however, predicting flood extents at the street and building levels in real-time is still computationally demanding. Here we present a hybrid process-based and data-driven machine learning (ML) approach for flood extent and inundation depth prediction. We used the Fourier neural operator (FNO), a highly efficient ML method, for surrogate modeling. The FNO model is demonstrated over an urban area in Houston (Texas, U.S.) by training using simulated water depths (in 15-min intervals) from six historical storm events and then tested over two holdout events. Results show FNO outperforms the baseline U-Net model. It maintains high predictability at all lead times tested (up to 3 hrs) and performs well when applying to new sites, suggesting strong generalization skill.",No

In this work, we leverage deep learning techniques for the automated classification of roof characteristics from very high-resolution orthophotos and airborne LiDAR data obtained in Dominica following Hurricane Maria in 2017. We demonstrate that the fusion of multimodal earth observation data performs better than using any single data source alone. Using our proposed methods, we achieve F1 scores of 0.93 and 0.92 for roof type and roof material classification, respectively. This work is intended to help governments produce more timely building information to improve resilience and disaster response in the Caribbean.",No
iccvw_2023_396,Deep Learning Driven Detection of Tsunami Related Internal Gravity Waves: a path towards open-ocean natural hazards detection.,"Tsunamis can trigger internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the ionosphere, perturbing the Total Electron Content (TEC) - referred to as Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) that are detectable through the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The GNSS are constellations of satellites providing signals from Earth orbit - Europeâ€™s Galileo, the United Statesâ€™ Global Positioning System (GPS), Russiaâ€™s Globalâ€™naya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS) and Chinaâ€™s BeiDou. The real-time detection of TIDs provides an approach for tsunami detection, enhancing early warning systems by providing open-ocean coverage in geographic areas not serviceable by buoy-based warning systems. Large volumes of the GNSS data is leveraged by deep learning, which effectively handles complex non-linear relationships across thousands of data streams. We describe a framework leveraging slant total electron content (sTEC) from the VARION (Variometric Approach for Real-Time Ionosphere Observation) algorithm by Gramian Angular Difference Fields (from Computer Vision) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect TIDs in near-real-time. Historical data from the 2010 Maule, 2011 Tohoku and the 2012 Haida-Gwaii earthquakes and tsunamis are used in model training, and the later-occurring 2015 Illapel earthquake and tsunami in Chile for out-of-sample model validation. Using the experimental framework described in the paper, we achieved a 91.7% F1 score. Source code is available at: https://github.com/vc1492a/tidd.

iccvw_2023_397,TeleViT: Teleconnection-driven Transformers Improve Subseasonal to Seasonal Wildfire Forecasting.,"Wildfires are increasingly exacerbated as a result of climate change, necessitating advanced proactive measures for effective mitigation. It is important to forecast wildfires weeks and months in advance to plan forest fuel management, resource procurement and allocation. To achieve such accurate long-term forecasts at a global scale, it is crucial to employ models that account for the Earth systemâ€™s inherent spatio-temporal interactions, such as memory effects and teleconnections. We propose a teleconnection-driven vision transformer (TeleViT), capable of treating the Earth as one interconnected system, integrating fine-grained local-scale inputs with global-scale inputs, such as climate indices and coarse-grained global variables. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate the superiority of TeleViT in accurately predicting global burned area patterns for various forecasting windows, up to four months in advance. The gain is especially pronounced in larger forecasting windows, demonstrating the improved ability of deep learning models that exploit teleconnections to capture Earth system dynamics.

iccvw_2023_398,"Rapid building damage assessment workflow: An implementation for the 2023 Rolling Fork, Mississippi tornado event.","Rapid and accurate building damage assessments from high-resolution satellite imagery following a natural disaster is essential to inform and optimize first responder efforts. However, performing such building damage assessments in an automated manner is non-trivial due to the challenges posed by variations in disaster-specific damage, diversity in satellite imagery, and the dearth of extensive, labeled datasets. To circumvent these issues, this paper introduces a human-in-the-loop workflow for rapidly training building damage assessment models after a natural disaster. This article details a case study using this workflow, executed in partnership with the American Red Cross during a tornado event in Rolling Fork, Mississippi in March, 2023. The output from our human-in-the-loop modeling process achieved a precision of 0.86 and recall of 0.80 for damaged buildings when compared to ground truth data collected post-disaster. This workflow was implemented end-to-end in under 2 hours per satellite imagery scene, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment.",No

We generated a total of 19,273 frames that have been used to evaluate FireFly on four popular object detection models. Further to minimize human intervention, we leveraged a trained model to create a semi-automatic labeling process for real-life ember frames.

iccvw_2023_400,Drones4Good: Supporting Disaster Relief Through Remote Sensing and AI.,"In order to respond effectively in the aftermath of a disaster, emergency services and relief organizations rely on timely and accurate information about the affected areas. Remote sensing has the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort required to collect such information by enabling a rapid survey of large areas. To achieve this, the main challenge is the automatic extraction of relevant information from remotely sensed data. In this work, we show how the combination of drone-based data with deep learning methods enables automated and large-scale situation assessment. In addition, we demonstrate the integration of onboard image processing techniques for the deployment of autonomous drone-based aid delivery. The results show the feasibility of a rapid and large-scale image analysis in the field, and that onboard image processing can increase the safety of drone-based aid deliveries.",No

In this study, we investigate a method to automatically estimate the damage status of people based on their actions in aerial drone images in order to understand disaster sites faster and save labor. We constructed a new dataset of aerial images of human actions in a hypothetical disaster that occurred in an urban area, and classified the human damage status using 3D ResNet. The results showed that the status with characteristic human actions could be classified with a recall rate of more than 80%, while other statuses with similar human actions could only be classified with a recall rate of about 50%. In addition, a cloud-based VR presentation application suggested the effectiveness of using drones to understand the disaster site and estimate the human condition.",No
iccvw_2023_402,Open Problems in Computer Vision for Wilderness SAR and The Search for Patricia Wu-Murad.,"This paper details the challenges in applying two computer vision systems, an EfficientDET supervised learning model and the unsupervised RX spectral classifier, to 98.9 GB of drone imagery from the Wu-Murad wilderness search and rescue (WSAR) effort in Japan and identifies 3 directions for future research. There have been at least 19 proposed approaches and 3 datasets aimed at locating missing persons in drone imagery, but only 3 approaches (2 unsupervised and 1 of an unknown structure) are referenced in the literature as having been used in an actual WSAR operation. Of these proposed approaches, the EfficientDET architecture and the unsupervised spectral RX classifier were selected as the most appropriate for this setting. The EfficientDET model was applied to the HERIDAL dataset and despite achieving performance that is statistically equivalent to the state-of-the-art, the model fails to translate to the real world in terms of false positives (e.g., identifying tree limbs and rocks as people), and false negatives (e.g., failing to identify members of the search team). The poor results in practice for algorithms that showed good results on datasets suggest 3 areas of future research: more realistic datasets for wilderness SAR, computer vision models that are capable of seamlessly handling the variety of imagery that can be collected during actual WSAR operations, and better alignment on performance measures.",No
iccvw_2023_403,ACTIS: Improving data efficiency by leveraging semi-supervised Augmentation Consistency Training for Instance Segmentation.,"Segmenting objects like cells or nuclei in biomedical microscopy data is a standard task required for many downstream analyses. However, existing pre-trained models are continuously challenged by ever-evolving experimental setups and imaging platforms. On the other hand, training new models still requires a considerable number of annotated samples, rendering it infeasible for small to midsized experiments. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach for instance segmentation that leverages a small number of annotated samples together with a larger number of unannotated samples. Our pipeline, Augmentation Consistency Training for Instance Segmentation (ACTIS), incorporates methods from consistency regularization and entropy minimization. In addition, we introduce a robust confidence-based loss masking scheme which we find empirically to work well on highly imbalanced class frequencies. We show that our model can surpass the performance of supervised models trained on more than twice as much annotated data. It achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets in the biomedical domain, demonstrating its effectiveness for semi-supervised instance segmentation.

Existing text-guided or style-transfer image-to-image approaches do not translate to datasets where additional information is provided as discrete classes. We introduce and implement a model which combines image-to-image and class-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models. We train our model on a real-world dataset of microscopy images used for drug discovery, with and without incorporating metadata labels. By exploring the properties of image-to-image diffusion with relevant labels, we show that class-guided image-to-image diffusion can improve the meaningful content of the reconstructed images and outperform the unguided model in useful downstream tasks.",No
iccvw_2023_405,Complex-Valued Retrievals From Noisy Images Using Diffusion Models.,"In diverse microscopy modalities, sensors measure only real-valued intensities. Additionally, the sensor readouts are affected by Poissonian-distributed photon noise. Traditional restoration algorithms typically aim to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and recovered images. This often leads to blurry outcomes with poor perceptual quality. Recently, deep diffusion models (DDMs) have proven to be highly capable of sampling images from the a-posteriori probability of the sought variables, resulting in visually pleasing high-quality images. These models have mostly been suggested for real-valued images suffering from Gaussian noise. In this study, we generalize annealed Langevin Dynamics, a type of DDM, to tackle the fundamental challenges in optical imaging of complex-valued objects (and real images) affected by Poisson noise. We apply our algorithm to various optical scenarios, such as Fourier Ptychography, Phase Retrieval, and Poisson denoising. Our algorithm is evaluated on simulations and biological empirical data.",No
iccvw_2023_406,Deep Learning Framework using Sparse Diffusion MRI for Diagnosis of Frontotemporal Dementia.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, leading to cognitive decline and behavioral changes. Early and accurate diagnosis of FTD is crucial for initiating timely interventions and providing appropriate care to patients. In the opinion of the experts , about 12-22 persons out of the population of 100,000 persons experience FTD. That means between 1.2 million and 1.8 million people have it worldwide. This research paper proposes a novel deep learning framework that utilizes sparse diffusion measures extracted from neuroimaging data to aid in the early diagnosis of Frontotemporal Dementia. The proposed model leverages the power of deep learning techniques to automatically learn relevant features from the data and effectively distinguish between healthy individuals and those with FTD. The experimental results demonstrate the promising potential of the proposed approach in improving FTD diagnosis and paving the way for future research in this area.",No
iccvw_2023_407,DeepContrast: Deep Tissue Contrast Enhancement using Synthetic Data Degradations and OOD Model Predictions.,"Microscopy images are crucial for life science research, allowing detailed inspection and characterization of cellular and tissue-level structures and functions. However, microscopy data are unavoidably affected by image degradations, such as noise, blur, or others. Many such degradations also contribute to a loss of image contrast, which becomes especially pronounced in deeper regions of thick samples. Today, best performing methods to increase the quality of images are based on Deep Learning approaches, which typically require ground truth (GT) data during training. Our inability to counteract blurring and contrast loss when imaging deep into samples prevents the acquisition of such clean GT data. The fact that the forward process of blurring and contrast loss deep into tissue can be mod-eled, allowed us to propose a new method that can circumvent the problem of unobtainable GT data. To this end, we first synthetically degraded the quality of microscopy images even further by using an approximate forward model for deep tissue image degradations. Then we trained a neural network that learned the inverse of this degradation function from our generated pairs of raw and degraded images. We demonstrated that networks trained in this way can be used out-of-distribution (OOD) to improve the quality of less severely degraded images, e.g. the raw data imaged in a microscope. Since the absolute level of degradation in such microscopy images can be stronger than the additional degradation introduced by our forward model, we also explored the effect of iterative predictions. Here, we observed that in each iteration the measured image contrast kept improving while detailed structures in the images got increasingly removed. Therefore, dependent on the desired downstream analysis, a balance between contrast improvement and retention of image details has to be found.",No
iccvw_2023_408,Direct Unsupervised Denoising.,"Traditional supervised denoisers are trained using pairs of noisy input and clean target images. They learn to predict a central tendency of the posterior distribution over possible clean images. When, e.g., trained with the popular quadratic loss function, the networkâ€™s output will correspond to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate. Unsupervised denoisers based on Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) have succeeded in achieving state-of-the-art results while requiring only unpaired noisy data as training input. In contrast to the traditional supervised approach, unsupervised denoisers do not directly produce a single prediction, such as the MMSE estimate, but allow us to draw samples from the posterior distribution of clean solutions corresponding to the noisy input. To approximate the MMSE estimate during inference, unsupervised methods have to create and draw a large number of samples â€“ a computationally expensive process, rendering the approach inapplicable in many situations. Here, we present an alternative approach that trains a deterministic network alongside the VAE to directly predict a central tendency. Our method achieves results that surpass the results achieved by the unsupervised method at a fraction of the computational cost.",No
iccvw_2023_409,Discrete Representation Learning for Modeling Imaging-based Spatial Transcriptomics Data.,"Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides single-transcript-level spatial resolution for hundreds of genes, unlike sequencing-based ST technologies whose resolution is limited to physical capture regions (spots) on slides. Existing methods to identify patterns of interest in imaging-based ST data are built as extensions of single cell analysis methods, mostly ignoring valuable spatial information encoded in the raw imaging data. Here we present a discrete representation learning approach for modeling spatial gene expression patterns in ST datasets. By employing raw coordinates of detected transcripts and positional encoding of cell centroids as inputs, we learn discrete representations using Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to extract multi-scale structures from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) based ST datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of discrete representations in terms of the quality of embedding of ST data as well as improved performance on downstream tasks for extracting biologically meaningful cellular neighborhoods and spatially variable genes.",No
iccvw_2023_410,Focus on Content not Noise: Improving Image Generation for Nuclei Segmentation by Suppressing Steganography in CycleGAN.,"Annotating nuclei in microscopy images for the training of neural networks is a laborious task that requires expert knowledge and suffers from inter- and intra-rater variability, especially in fluorescence microscopy. Generative networks such as CycleGAN can inverse the process and generate synthetic microscopy images for a given mask, thereby building a synthetic dataset. However, past works report content inconsistencies between the mask and generated image, partially due to CycleGAN minimizing its loss by hiding shortcut information for the image reconstruction in high frequencies rather than encoding the desired image content and learning the target task. In this work, we propose to remove the hidden shortcut information, called steganography, from generated images by employing a low pass filtering based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT). We show that this increases coherence between generated images and cycled masks and evaluate synthetic datasets on a downstream nuclei segmentation task. Here we achieve an improvement of 5.4 percentage points in the F1-score compared to a vanilla CycleGAN. Integrating advanced regularization techniques into the CycleGAN architecture may help mitigate steganography-related issues and produce more accurate synthetic datasets for nuclei segmentation.",No
iccvw_2023_411,Generating Synthetic Computed Tomography (CT) Images to Improve the Performance of Machine Learning Model for Pediatric Abdominal Anomaly Detection.,"Abdominal pain is one of the most common symptoms for a wide range of conditions in children, under the age of 16 years. Due to the limited ability of X-ray to distinguish between structures in soft tissue, physicians often rely on Computed Tomography (CT) scan to diagnose the underlying cause of abdominal pain. A CT scan exposes the patient to 70-150 times the radiation used for an X-ray. Moreover, CT scanning equipment is often not available in low-resource countries, leading to improper diagnosis and treatment. Children are more susceptible to the harmful effects of radiation than adults and might have limited language skills, based on age, and hence limited ability to describe their symptoms to the physician. In this work, we show that it is possible to use a Machine Learning (ML) model, capable of generating synthetic CT scans, from orthogonal X-ray scans, to improve the automatic prediction of abdominal anomalies. In particular, we focus on the detection of structural anomalies such as malformed organs, cysts, and appendicitis. On average, we are able to improve the performance of the prediction model by 9.75%, with respect to the model trained on only X-ray and 4.55%, with respect to the model trained on only generated CT scan, by training it on both the generated CT scan and X-ray.",No
iccvw_2023_412,Leveraging Classic Deconvolution and Feature Extraction in Zero-Shot Image Restoration.,"Non-blind deconvolution aims to restore a sharp image from its blurred counterpart given an obtained kernel. Existing deep neural architectures are often built based on large datasets of sharp ground truth images and trained with supervision. Sharp, high quality ground truth images, however, are not always available, especially for biomedical applications. This severely hampers the applicability of current approaches in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel non-blind deconvolution method that leverages the power of deep learning and classic iterative deconvolution algorithms. Our approach combines a pre-trained network to extract deep features from the input image with iterative Richardson-Lucy deconvolution steps. Subsequently, a zero-shot optimisation process is employed to integrate the deconvolved features, resulting in a high-quality reconstructed image. By performing the preliminary reconstruction with the classic iterative deconvolution method, we can effectively utilise a smaller network to produce the final image, thus accelerating the reconstruction whilst reducing the demand for valuable computational resources. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in various real-world applications non-blind deconvolution tasks.",No
iccvw_2023_413,NU-Net: a self-supervised smart filter for enhancing blobs in bioimages.,"While supervised deep neural networks have become the dominant method for image analysis tasks in bioimages, truly versatile methods are not available yet because of the diversity of modalities and conditions and the cost of retraining. In practice, day-to-day biological image analysis still largely relies on ad hoc workflows often using classical linear filters. We propose NU-Net, a convolutional neural network filter selectively enhancing cells and nuclei, as a drop-in replacement of chains of classical linear filters in bioimage analysis pipelines. Using a style transfer architecture, a novel perceptual loss implicitly learns a soft separation of background and foreground. We used self-supervised training using 25 datasets covering diverse modalities of nuclear and cellular images. We show its ability to selectively improve contrast, remove background and enhance objects across a wide range of datasets and workflow while keeping image content. The pre-trained models are light and practical, and published as free and open-source software for the community. NU-Net is also available as a plugin for Napari.",No
iccvw_2023_414,On the risk of manual annotations in 3D confocal microscopy image segmentation.,"Image segmentation in 3D confocal fluorescence microscopy images is a common problem in many biomedical studies. Deep learning-based methods have achieved great success on such tasks. In the literature, manual 3D annotations are still commonly used for model training or performance evaluation. But, due to the nature of the lens-based optical instruments, diffraction of light always occurs, which can lead to obscure boundaries of the biomedical structures being imaged. For example, when analyzing nuclei from 3D fluorescence microscopy images of cells marked by DNA dyes, the exact boundaries are usually not clearly identifiable, especially along Z. This makes accurate segmentation, both manually and automatically, very challenging. For applications where the boundary accuracy is crucial, the downstream analyses can thus be significantly compromised. This problem can be addressed with special experimental-computational co-design to acquire the ""biological ground truth"". For the nuclei example, we can take cells expressing mEGFP tagged lamin B1, from which we can acquire both the DNA dye channel (nucleus) and the lamin B1 channel (nuclear envelope). Lamin B1 signals clearly mark the nuclei boundary and can thus serve as the real truth. We demonstrate that training a deep learning-based nuclei instance segmentation model with biological ground truth and manual annotations will result in significant differences in various metrics, such as volume or application-specific measurements. Also, we show the universalness of such issues with manual annotations by testing different state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods. We hope our work can raise within the biomedical image analysis community the awareness of (1) the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations, e.g., computational-experimental co-design for biological ground truth collection, and (2) potentially significant issues with manual annotation in training or evaluating deep learning-based segmentation models.",No
iccvw_2023_415,PCTrans: Position-Guided Transformer with Query Contrast for Biological Instance Segmentation.,"Recently, query-based transformer gradually draws attention in segmentation tasks due to its powerful ability. Compared to instance segmentation in natural images, biological instance segmentation is more challenging due to high texture similarity, crowded objects and limited annotations. Therefore, it remains a pending issue to extract meaningful queries to model biological instances. In this paper, we analyze the problem when queries meet biological images and propose a novel Position-guided Transformer with query Contrast (PCTrans) for biological instance segmentation. PCTrans tackles the mentioned issue in two ways. First, for high texture similarity and crowded objects, we incorporate position information to guide query learning and mask prediction. This involves considering position similarity when learning queries and designing a dynamic mask head that takes instance position into account. Second, to learn more discriminative representation of the queries under limited annotated data, we further design two contrastive losses, namely Query Embedding Contrastive (QEC) loss and Mask Candidate Contrastive (MCC) loss. Experiments on two representative biological instance segmentation datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCTrans over existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/qic999/PCTrans.",No
iccvw_2023_416,Reinforcement learning for instance segmentation with high-level priors.,"Instance segmentation is a fundamental computer vision problem which remains challenging despite impressive recent advances due to deep learning-based methods. Given sufficient training data, fully supervised methods can yield excellent performance, but annotation of groundtruth remains a major bottleneck, especially for biomedical applications where it has to be performed by domain experts. The amount of labels required can be drastically reduced by using rules derived from prior knowledge to guide the segmentation. However, these rules are in general not differentiable and thus cannot be used with existing methods. Here, we revoke this requirement by using stateless actor critic reinforcement learning, which enables non-differentiable rewards. We formulate the instance segmentation problem as graph partitioning and the actor critic predicts the edge weights driven by the rewards, which are based on the conformity of segmented instances to high-level priors on object shape, position or size. The experiments on toy and real data demonstrate that a good set of priors is sufficient to reach excellent performance without any direct object-level supervision.",No
iccvw_2023_417,SortedAP: Rethinking evaluation metrics for instance segmentation.,"Designing metrics for evaluating instance segmentation revolves around comprehensively considering object detection and segmentation accuracy. However, other important properties, such as sensitivity, continuity, and equality, are overlooked in the current study. In this paper, we reveal that most existing metrics have a limited resolution of segmentation quality. They are only conditionally sensitive to the change of masks or false predictions. For certain metrics, the score can change drastically in a narrow range which could provide a misleading indication of the quality gap between results. Therefore, we propose a new metric called sortedAP, which strictly decreases with both object- and pixel-level imperfections and has an uninterrupted penalization scale over the entire domain. We provide the evaluation toolkit and experiment code at https://www.github.com/looooongChen/sortedAP.",No
iccvw_2023_418,Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Patient-Derived Organoid Videos Using Deep Learning for the Prediction of Drug Efficacy.,"Over the last ten years, Patient-Derived Organoids (PDOs) emerged as the most reliable technology to generate ex-vivo tumor avatars. PDOs retain the main characteristics of their original tumor, making them a system of choice for pre-clinical and clinical studies. In particular, PDOs are attracting interest in the field of Functional Precision Medicine (FPM), which is based upon an ex-vivo drug test in which living tumor cells (such as PDOs) from a specific patient are exposed to a panel of anti-cancer drugs. Currently, the Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) based cell viability assay is the gold standard test to assess the sensitivity of PDOs to drugs. The readout is measured at the end of the assay from a global PDO population and therefore does not capture single PDO responses and does not provide time resolution of drug effect. To this end, in this study, we explore for the first time the use of powerful large foundation models for the automatic processing of PDO data. In particular, we propose a novel imaging-based high-throughput screening method to assess real-time drug efficacy from a time-lapse microscopy video of PDOs. The recently proposed SAM algorithm for segmentation and DI-NOv2 model are adapted in a comprehensive pipeline for processing PDO microscopy frames. Moreover, an attention mechanism is proposed for fusing temporal and spatial features in a multiple instance learning setting to predict ATP. We report better results than other non-time-resolved methods, indicating that the temporality of data is an important factor for the prediction of ATP. Extensive ablations shed light on optimizing the experimental setting and automating the prediction both in real-time and for forecasting.",No

However, predicting accurate instance-wise segmentation and cell motions from microscopy imagery remains a challenging task. Using microstructured environments for analyzing single cells in a constant flow of media adds additional complexity. While large-scale labeled microscopy datasets are available, we are not aware of any large-scale dataset, including both cells and microstructures. In this paper, we introduce the trapped yeast cell (TYC) dataset, a novel dataset for understanding instance-level semantics and motions of cells in microstructures. We release 105 dense annotated high-resolution brightfield microscopy images, including about 19k instance masks. We also release 261 curated video clips composed of 1293 high-resolution microscopy images to facilitate unsupervised understanding of cell motions and morphology. TYC offers ten times more instance annotations than the previously largest dataset, including cells and microstructures. Our effort also exceeds previous attempts in terms of microstructure variability, resolution, complexity, and capturing device (microscopy) variability. We facilitate a unified comparison on our novel dataset by introducing a standardized evaluation strategy. TYC and evaluation code are publicly available under CC BY 4.0 license.",No

In this work, we propose a Transformer-based multiple instance learning method that replaces the traditional learned attention mechanism with a regional, Vision Transformer inspired self-attention mechanism. We additionally propose a method that fuses regional patch information to derive slide-level predictions. We then show how this regional aggregation can be stacked to hierarchically process features on different distance levels. To increase predictive accuracy, especially for datasets with small, local morphological features, we also suggest a method to focus the image processing on high attention regions during inference. Our approach is able to significantly improve performance over the baseline on two histopathology datasets and points towards promising directions for further research.",No

This is especially so in the field of bio-imaging, where the raw data is often voluminous, yet extremely variable and difficult to study. However, one persistent challenge in deep learning assisted scientific discovery is that the workings of artificial neural networks are often difficult to interpret. Here we present a simple technique for investigating the behavior of trained neural networks: virtual perturbation. By making precise and systematic alterations to input data or internal representations thereof, we are able to discover causal relationships in the outputs of a deep learning model, and by extension, in the underlying phenomenon itself. As an exemplar, we use a recently described deep-learning based cell fate prediction model. We trained the network to predict the fate of less fit cells in an experimental model of mechanical cell competition.

We compare these with known properties of the biological system under investigation to demonstrate that the model faithfully captures insights previously established by experimental research.",No
iccvw_2023_423,On the Interplay of Convolutional Padding and Adversarial Robustness.,"It is common practice to apply padding prior to convolution operations to preserve the resolution of feature-maps in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While many alternatives exist, this is often achieved by adding a border of zeros around the inputs. In this work, we show that adversarial attacks often result in perturbation anomalies at the image boundaries, which are the areas where padding is used. Consequently, we aim to provide an analysis of the interplay between padding and adversarial attacks and seek an answer to the question of how different padding modes (or their absence) affect adversarial robustness in various scenarios.",Yes
iccvw_2023_424,What Does Really Count? Estimating Relevance of Corner Cases for Semantic Segmentation in Automated Driving.,"In safety-critical applications such as automated driving, perception errors may create an imminent risk to vulnerable road users (VRU). To mitigate the occurrence of unexpected and potentially dangerous situations, so-called corner cases, perception models are trained on a huge amount of data. However, the models are typically evaluated using task-agnostic metrics, which do not reflect the severity of safety-critical misdetections. Consequently, mis-detections with particular relevance for the safe driving task should entail a more severe penalty during evaluation to pinpoint corner cases in large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose a novel metric IoUw that exploits relevance on the pixel level of the semantic segmentation output to extend the notion of the intersection over union (IoU) by emphasizing small areas of an image affected by corner cases. We (i) employ IoUw to measure the effect of pre-defined relevance criteria on the segmentation evaluation, and (ii) use the relevance-adapted IoUw to refine the identification of corner cases. In our experiments, we investigate vision-based relevance criteria and physical attributes as per-pixel criticality to factor in the imminent risk, showing that IoUw precisely accentuates the relevance of corner cases.",No
iccvw_2023_425,GPS-GLASS: Learning Nighttime Semantic Segmentation Using Daytime Video and GPS data.,"Semantic segmentation for autonomous driving should be robust against various in-the-wild environments. Nighttime semantic segmentation is especially challenging due to a lack of annotated nighttime images and a large domain gap from daytime images with sufficient annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel GPS-based training framework for nighttime semantic segmentation. Given GPS-aligned pairs of daytime and nighttime images, we perform cross-domain correspondence matching to obtain pixel-level pseudo supervision. Moreover, we conduct flow estimation between daytime video frames and apply GPS-based scaling to acquire another pixel-level pseudo supervision. Using these pseudo supervisions with a confidence map, we train a nighttime semantic segmentation network without any annotation from nighttime images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several nighttime semantic segmentation datasets.",No
iccvw_2023_426,Camera-Based Road Snow Coverage Estimation.,"The current road condition is a crucial factor regarding road safety of the ego-vehicle and other road users. Road condition estimation provides essential input data for friction estimation which is used for autonomous and automated driving systems. Camera-based approaches are still far from being practical and other sensors dominate the field of friction estimation. This is due to the limited performance of current approaches and the lack of datasets for the incorporation of learning-based methods.We propose a novel dataset for a special scenario of road condition, the coverage with snow. It is the first large-scale dataset for camera-based road classification of snow-covered roads with different types of snow coverage. The dataset consists of road patches in birdâ€™s eye view perspective and ground truth annotation for the current snow coverage type. It is combinable with RoadSaW [4], a dataset for road surface and wetness estimation, leading to a holistic road condition dataset with 15 categories. The baseline evaluation employs state-of-the-art, real-time capable approaches for classification and uncertainty estimation with RBF (Radial Basis Function) networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed data opens new challenges in the field of camera-based road condition estimation.",No
iccvw_2023_427,You can have your ensemble and run it too - Deep Ensembles Spread Over Time.,"Ensembles of independently trained deep neural networks yield uncertainty estimates that rival Bayesian networks in performance. They also offer sizable improvements in terms of predictive performance over single models. However, deep ensembles are not commonly used in environments with limited computational budget â€“ such as autonomous driving â€“ since the complexity grows linearly with the number of ensemble members. An important observation that can be made for robotics applications, such as autonomous driving, is that data is typically sequential. For instance, when an object is to be recognized, an autonomous vehicle typically observes a sequence of images, rather than a single image. This raises the question, could the deep ensemble be spread over time?In this work, we propose and analyze Deep Ensembles Spread Over Time (DESOT). The idea is to apply only a single ensemble member to each data point in the sequence, and fuse the predictions over a sequence of data points. We implement and experiment with DESOT for traffic sign classification, where sequences of tracked image patches are to be classified. We find that DESOT obtains the benefits of deep ensembles, in terms of predictive and uncertainty estimation performance, while avoiding the added computational cost. Moreover, DESOT is simple to implement and does not require sequences during training. Finally, we find that DESOT, like deep ensembles, outperform single models for out-of-distribution detection.",No
iccvw_2023_428,T-FFTRadNet: Object Detection with Swin Vision Transformers from Raw ADC Radar Signals.,"Object detection utilizing Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar is becoming increasingly popular in the field of autonomous systems. Radar does not possess the same drawbacks seen by other emission-based sensors such as LiDAR, primarily the degradation or loss of return signals due to weather conditions such as rain or snow. However, radar does possess traits that make it unsuitable for standard emission-based deep learning representations such as point clouds. Radar point clouds tend to be sparse and therefore information extraction is not efficient. To overcome this, more traditional digital signal processing pipelines were adapted to form inputs residing directly in the frequency domain via Fast Fourier Transforms. Commonly, three transformations were used to form Range-Azimuth-Doppler cubes in which deep learning algorithms could perform object detection. This too has drawbacks, namely the pre-processing costs associated with performing multiple Fourier Transforms and normalization. We explore the possibility of operating on raw radar inputs from analog to digital converters via the utilization of complex transformation layers. Moreover, we introduce hierarchical Swin Vision transformers to the field of radar object detection and show their capability to operate on inputs varying in pre-processing, along with different radar configurations, i.e., relatively low and high numbers of transmitters and receivers, while obtaining on par or better results than the state-of-the-art.",No
iccvw_2023_429,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Self-Driving from Past Traversal Features.,"The rapid development of 3D object detection systems for self-driving cars has significantly improved accuracy. However, these systems struggle to generalize across diverse driving environments, which can lead to safety-critical failures in detecting traffic participants. To address this, we propose a method that utilizes unlabeled repeated traversals of multiple locations to adapt object detectors to new driving environments. By incorporating statistics computed from repeated LiDAR scans, we guide the adaptation process effectively. Our approach enhances LiDAR-based detection models using spatial quantized historical features and introduces a lightweight regression head to leverage the statistics for feature regularization. Additionally, we leverage the statistics for a novel self-training process to stabilize the training. The framework is detector model-agnostic and experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements, achieving up to a 20-point performance gain, especially in detecting pedestrians and distant objects.

iccvw_2023_430,Introspection of 2D Object Detection using Processed Neural Activation Patterns in Automated Driving Systems.,"While deep neural network (DNN) models have become extremely popular for object detection in automated driving systems (ADS), the dynamic and varied nature of the road traffic environment can still lead to model failures. To address this issue, researchers have recently explored introspection mechanisms, a.k.a, self-assessment, for monitoring the quality of perception in ADS. Subsequently, depending on the situation, these mechanisms can either hand over control to the human driver in SAE Level 3, or initiate a minimum risk maneuver in SAE Level 4 ADS. State-of-the-art introspection mechanisms for ADS train a neural network to learn the relationship between the raw neural activation patterns of the underlying DNN-based perception function per frame and the calculated mean average precision. In this paper, we show that the use of raw activation patterns may contain misleading information for introspecting 2D object detection in ADS. To this end, we investigate how to optimally pre-process these patterns for improving the error detection performance. We evaluate the developed mechanism with and without pre-processing of the raw neural activation patterns and compare its performance with a state-of-the-art algorithm highlighting that for the Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) dataset, pre-processing reduced the ratio of missed errors by 14% and improved the overall detection performance by 3%.",No
iccvw_2023_431,Synthetic Dataset Acquisition for a Specific Target Domain.,"Intelligent sampling from simulation becomes crucial due to storage and hardware constraints. This research focuses on developing an intelligent acquisition strategy for synthetic data and evaluates multiple approaches to address the limitations of existing domain adaptation methods. Selecting suitable synthetic data for real-world model training presents challenges, as accurately representing the real world remains elusive. We tackle the task of adapting from synthetic to real-world data through unsupervised domain adaptation, a challenging setting for perception systems. The performance of our acquisition function is measured by its facilitation of this adaptation.We showcase different strategies, to assign value to synthetic images. Acquisition functions either operate based on synthetic data alone or take the given real world target domain into account, to assign a value to synthetic images. Leveraging assumptions from semi-supervised learning, we identify challenging real-world images and find their counterparts in the synthetic world. Evaluation is conducted using the GTA-5 dataset as the representative synthetic world and the Cityscapes and ACDC dataset as the target do-main. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation approaches are employed to assess the effectiveness of our acquisition function.By advancing the utilization of synthetic data in training perception systems, this research contributes to improved real-world performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of intelligent acquisition strategies for enhancing the adaptation from synthetic to real-world domains.",No
iccvw_2023_432,Anomaly-Aware Semantic Segmentation via Style-Aligned OoD Augmentation.,"Within the context of autonomous driving, encountering unknown objects becomes inevitable during deployment in the open world. Therefore, it is crucial to equip standard semantic segmentation models with anomaly awareness. Many previous approaches have utilized synthetic out-of-distribution (OoD) data augmentation to tackle this problem. In this work, we advance the OoD synthesis process by reducing the domain gap between the OoD data and driving scenes, effectively mitigating the style difference that might otherwise act as an obvious shortcut during training. Additionally, we propose a simple fine-tuning loss that effectively induces a pre-trained semantic segmentation model to generate a ""none of the given classes"" prediction, leveraging per-pixel OoD scores for anomaly segmentation. With minimal fine-tuning effort, our pipeline enables the use of pre-trained models for anomaly segmentation while maintaining the performance on the original task.",No
iccvw_2023_433,An Empirical Analysis of Range for 3D Object Detection.,"LiDAR-based 3D detection plays a vital role in autonomous navigation. Surprisingly, although autonomous vehicles (AVs) must detect both near-field objects (for collision avoidance) and far-field objects (for longer-term planning), contemporary benchmarks focus only on near-field 3D detection. However, AVs must detect far-field objects for safe navigation. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of far-field 3D detection using the long-range detection dataset Argoverse 2.0 to better understand the problem, and share the following insight: near-field LiDAR measurements are dense and optimally encoded by small voxels, while far-field measurements are sparse and are better encoded with large voxels. We exploit this observation to build a collection of range experts tuned for near-vs-far field detection, and propose simple techniques to efficiently ensemble models for long-range detection that improve efficiency by 33% and boost accuracy by 3.2% CDS.",No
iccvw_2023_434,On Offline Evaluation of 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving.,"Prior work in 3D object detection evaluates models using offline metrics like average precision since closed-loop online evaluation on the downstream driving task is costly.

In this work, we perform the first empirical evaluation measuring how predictive different detection metrics are of driving performance when detectors are integrated into a full self-driving stack. We conduct extensive experiments on urban driving in the CARLA simulator using 16 object detection models. We find that the nuScenes Detection Score has a higher correlation to driving performance than the widely used average precision metric. In addition, our results call for caution on the exclusive reliance on the emerging class of â€˜planner-centricâ€™ metrics.",No
iccvw_2023_435,Identifying Systematic Errors in Object Detectors with the SCROD Pipeline.,"The identification and removal of systematic errors in object detectors can be a prerequisite for their deployment in safety-critical applications like automated driving and robotics. Such systematic errors can for instance occur under very specific object poses (location, scale, orientation), object colors/textures, and backgrounds. Real images alone are unlikely to cover all relevant combinations. We overcome this limitation by generating synthetic images with fine-granular control. While generating synthetic images with physical simulators and hand-designed 3D assets allows fine-grained control over generated images, this approach is resource-intensive and has limited scalability. In contrast, using generative models is more scalable but less reliable in terms of fine-grained control. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the strengths of both approaches. Our meticulously designed pipeline along with custom models enables us to generate street scenes with fine-grained control in a fully automated and scalable manner. Moreover, our framework introduces an evaluation setting that can serve as a benchmark for similar pipelines. This evaluation setting will contribute to advancing the field and promoting standardized testing procedures.",No
iccvw_2023_436,Sensitivity analysis of AI-based algorithms for autonomous driving on optical wavefront aberrations induced by the windshield.,"Autonomous driving perception techniques are typically based on supervised machine learning models that are trained on real-world street data. A typical training process involves capturing images with a single car model and windshield configuration. However, deploying these trained models on different car types can lead to a domain shift, which can potentially hurt the neural networks performance and violate working ADAS requirements. To address this issue, this paper investigates the domain shift problem further by evaluating the sensitivity of two perception models to different windshield configurations. This is done by evaluating the dependencies between neural network benchmark metrics and optical merit functions by applying a Fourier optics based threat model. Our results show that there is a performance gap introduced by windshields and existing optical metrics used for posing requirements might not be sufficient.",No

We conducted three experiments to evaluate our approach: examining components choice on test set performance when intentionally overfitting, training on one anomaly type and testing on others, and examining training with a minimal image set based on anomaly types. Unlike traditional methods that emphasize variance, our focus is on maximizing performance and understanding component behavior in diverse settings. Results show our technique outperforms both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Negated PCA (NPCA), suggesting a promising advancement in AD efficiency and effectiveness.",No
iccvw_2023_438,Sub-Ensembles for Fast Uncertainty Estimation in Neural Networks.,"Fast estimates of model uncertainty are required for many robust robotics applications. Deep Ensembles provides state of the art uncertainty without requiring Bayesian methods, but still it is computationally expensive due to the use of large ensembles. In this paper we propose deep sub-ensembles, an approximation to deep ensembles where the core idea is to ensemble only a selection of layers close to the output, and not the whole model. This is motivated by feature hierarchy learned by convolutional networks that should allow for feature reuse across ensembles. With ResNet-20 on the CIFAR10 dataset, we obtain 1.5-2.5 speedup over a deep ensemble, with a small increase in error and loss, and similarly up to 5-15 speedup with a VGG-like network on the SVHN dataset. Our results show that this idea enables a trade-off between error and uncertainty quality versus computational performance as a sub-ensemble effectively works as an approximation of a deep ensemble.",No
iccvw_2023_439,A Simple and Robust Framework for Cross-Modality Medical Image Segmentation applied to Vision Transformers.,"When it comes to clinical images, automatic segmentation has a wide variety of applications and a considerable diversity of input domains, such as different types of Magnetic Resonance Images and Computerized Tomography scans. This heterogeneity is a challenge for cross-modality algorithms that should equally perform independently of the input image type fed to them. Often, segmentation models are trained using a single modality, preventing generalization to other types of input data without resorting to transfer learning techniques. Furthermore, the multi-modal or cross-modality architectures proposed in the literature frequently require registered images, which are not easy to collect in clinical environments, or need additional processing steps, such as synthetic image generation. In this work, we propose a simple framework to achieve fair image segmentation of multiple modalities using a single conditional model that adapts its normalization layers based on the input type, trained with non-registered interleaved mixed data. We show that our framework outperforms other cross-modality segmentation methods, when applied to the same 3D UNet baseline model, on the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation Challenge. Furthermore, we define the Conditional Vision Transformer encoder, based on the proposed cross-modality framework, and we show that it brings significant improvements to the resulting segmentation, up to 6.87% of Dice accuracy, with respect to its baseline reference.

iccvw_2023_441,Exploring Image Classification Robustness and Interpretability with Right for the Right Reasons Data Augmentation.,"Right for the right reasons (RRR) methods have been proposed to mitigate the issues of shortcut learning in deep learning models. During training, these methods guide the models to learn patterns from signal information while ignoring noisy features. This work investigates the robustness of image classification models to background sensitivity, referring to a modelâ€™s capability to accurately classify an image without leveraging the shortcut learning between the image background and the assigned input label. We propose a new approach, the Right for the Right Reasons Data Augmentation (RRDA). This approach augments the image foreground context with the context extracted from different images, thereby stimulating the model to focus on signal features rather than the context. Our experiments demonstrate that RRDA can significantly improve the robustness of image classification models, outperforming other RRR methods, such as GradMask and ActDiff. We also evaluate the impact of architectural choice on robustness, showing that ViT is more robust than ResNet in handling background sensitivity. Finally, we perform an interpretability analysis to understand how models assign importance to signal and context features during the inference process. This involves computing the signal-to-noise ratio as the importance of the signal divided by the importance of the context. Contrary to our expectations, our findings suggest that a high signal-to-noise ratio does not necessarily imply robustness. However, they indicate that applying RRDA can help the models learn to focus on signal features, leading to more interpretable and robust models.",No

Recent studies have demonstrated that optimizing these coding elements improves the performance of solving the inverse problem. Specifically, to include a coding element without sacrificing the light throughput of the optical system, Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs) have been employed. Recent works have highlighted the significance of shift-variant systems, which allows an optimized coding for each spatial portion of the scene and for each wavelength. With this in mind, this work proposes a shift-variant optical system using double-phase coding elements by implementing a double DOE architecture.

iccvw_2023_445,Generative Approach for Probabilistic Human Mesh Recovery using Diffusion Models.,"This work focuses on the problem of reconstructing a 3D human body mesh from a given 2D image. Despite the inherent ambiguity of the task of human mesh recovery, most existing works have adopted a method of regressing a single output. In contrast, we propose a generative approach framework, called ""Diffusion-based Human Mesh Recovery (Diff-HMR)"" that takes advantage of the denoising diffusion process to account for multiple plausible outcomes. During the training phase, the SMPL parameters are diffused from ground-truth parameters to random distribution, and Diff-HMR learns the reverse process of this diffusion. In the inference phase, the model progressively refines the given random SMPL parameters into the corresponding parameters that align with the input image. Diff-HMR, being a generative approach, is capable of generating diverse results for the same input image as the input noise varies. We conduct validation experiments, and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively models the inherent ambiguity of the task of human mesh recovery in a probabilistic manner.

To address this issue, we propose to construct dense correspondences between initial human model estimates and the corresponding images that can be used to refine the initial predictions. To this end, we utilize renderings of the 3D models to predict per-pixel 2D displacements between the synthetic renderings and the RGB images. This allows us to effectively integrate and exploit appearance information of the persons. Our per-pixel displacements can be efficiently transformed to per-visible-vertex displacements and then used for 3D model refinement by minimizing a reprojection loss. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we refine the initial 3D human mesh predictions of multiple models using different refinement procedures on 3DPW and RICH.

iccvw_2023_447,Extract-and-Adaptation Network for 3D Interacting Hand Mesh Recovery.,"Understanding how two hands interact with each other is a key component of accurate 3D interacting hand mesh recovery. However, recent Transformer-based methods struggle to learn the interaction between two hands as they directly utilize two hand features as input tokens, which results in distant token problem. The distant token problem represents that input tokens are in heterogeneous spaces, leading Transformer to fail in capturing correlation between input tokens. Previous Transformer-based methods suffer from the problem especially when poses of two hands are very different as they project features from a backbone to separate left and right hand-dedicated features. We present EANet, extract-and-adaptation network, with EABlock, the main component of our network. Rather than directly uti-lizing two hand features as input tokens, our EABlock uti-lizes two complementary types of novel tokens, SimToken and JoinToken, as input tokens. Our two novel tokens are from a combination of separated two hand features; hence, it is much more robust to the distant token problem. Using the two type of tokens, our EABlock effectively extracts interaction feature and adapts it to each hand.

iccvw_2023_448,Effective Whole-body Pose Estimation with Two-stages Distillation.,"Whole-body pose estimation localizes the human body, hand, face, and foot keypoints in an image. This task is challenging due to multi-scale body parts, fine-grained localization for low-resolution regions, and data scarcity. Meanwhile, applying a highly efficient and accurate pose estimator to widely human-centric understanding and generation tasks is urgent. In this work, we present a two-stage pose Distillation for Whole-body Pose estimators, named DWPose, to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. The first-stage distillation designs a weight-decay strategy while utilizing a teacherâ€™s intermediate feature and final logits with both visible and invisible keypoints to supervise the student from scratch. The second stage distills the student model itself to further improve performance. Different from the previous self-knowledge distillation, this stage finetunes the studentâ€™s head with only 20% training time as a plug-and-play training strategy.

They inherently align both the geometric and color information of an image, making them valuable to address this challenging problem. Hence, we propose a method, Point Intrinsic Net (PoInt-Net), which jointly predicts the albedo, light source direction, and shading by leveraging point cloud representations.

To this end, we present a system which is built upon a novel hybrid volumetric scene representation in terms of the combination of a voxel-based scene representation for the static contents, that not only stores the reconstructed surface geometry but also contains information about the object semantics as well as their accumulated dynamic movement over time, and a point-cloud-based representation for dynamic scene parts, where the respective separation from static parts is achieved based on semantic and instance information extracted for the input frames. With an independent yet simultaneous streaming of both static and dynamic content, where we seamlessly integrate potentially moving but currently static scene entities in the static model until they are becoming dynamic again, as well as the fusion of static and dynamic data at the remote client, our system is able to achieve VR-based live-telepresence at close to real-time rates.

This makes it even easier to build and test the end-to-end pipeline. The resulting custom HGR is then ready to be run on-device for real-time scenarios.

iccvw_2023_455,MAMMOS: MApping Multiple human MOtion with Scene understanding and natural interactions.,"We present MAMMOS, an automated framework that generates the motions of multiple humans that naturally interact with each other in a given 3D scene. Many practical VR scenarios require creating dynamic human characters in harmony with the surrounding environment and other people. However, it is hard for an artist to manually generate multiple character motions tailored to the given 3D scene structure, or gather sufficient data to train an automated system that jointly considers the entangled requirements. MAMMOS is a hierarchical framework that successfully handles spatio-temporal constraints and generates high-quality motions. Given a simple tuple of action labels of the desired motion sequence, MAMMOS first places anchors in time and location for characters that avoid collisions yet enable necessary interactions. Then we generate the timelines of individual collision-free paths within the scene and connect them to perform diverse and natural motions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate long-horizon motion sequences of multiple humans with realistic interactions such that we can automatically populate the 3D scenes.",No

iccvw_2023_457,FArMARe: a Furniture-Aware Multi-task methodology for Recommending Apartments based on the user interests.,"Nowadays, many people frequently have to search for new accommodation options. Searching for a suitable apartment is a time-consuming process, especially because visiting them is often mandatory to assess the truthfulness of the advertisements found on the Web. While this process could be alleviated by visiting the apartments in the metaverse, the Web-based recommendation platforms are not suitable for the task. To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we define a new problem called text-to-apartment recommendation, which requires ranking the apartments based on their relevance to a textual query expressing the userâ€™s interests. To tackle this problem, we introduce FArMARe, a multi-task approach that supports cross-modal contrastive training with a furniture-aware objective. Since public datasets related to indoor scenes do not contain detailed descriptions of the furniture, we collect and annotate a dataset comprising more than 6000 apartments. A thorough experimentation with three different methods and two raw feature extraction procedures reveals the effectiveness of FArMARe in dealing with the problem at hand.",No
iccvw_2023_458,Confusing Large Models by Confusing Small Models.,"Despite a steady growth in average accuracy, computer vision models continue to fail on many robustness benchmarks. In this paper, we take a step back from standard benchmarks and focus on how models perceive data, and which aspects of the data they find confusing. Using an ensemble-based confusion score we examine how the training and test samples appear simple or confusing to a given model. Based on these heuristics, we demonstrate an application of the confusion score in identifying images that appear confusing to the trained model, and show that these images are highly likely to be misclassified by the model. We further demonstrate how confusion carries over to models of various sizes and architectures, which gives rise to the possibility of identifying challenging images via ensembles of small networks to produce a custom benchmark of challenging data, that remains appropriate for large models where ensembling is costly to implement. Finally, we demonstrate how training via upsampling on confusing images can improve accuracy on the hard subset.",No
iccvw_2023_459,Misalignment-Free Relation Aggregation for Multi-Source-Free Domain Adaptation.,"In multi-source-free domain adaptation (MSFDA), it is important to effectively fuse latent features from multiple source models to improve adaptation performance on target domain. Existing works weightedly sum source-model features for fusion, which cannot fully leverage the discriminativity of features due to misaligned semantics, and is not applicable to source models with non-identical feature dimensionalities. To mitigate these issues, we propose the idea of misalignment-free relation aggregation (MFRA): instead of directly summing the features, we aggregate the similarity relationships between target samples in each source-model feature space. Specifically, for each source model, we first compute the similarities between the target sample of interest and all the other target samples. The resulting similarities are then summed along the source models to produce the aggregated similarity. To leverage the aggregated similarity in adaptation, a peer-supervised contrastive learning and an adversarial training scheme are designed to transfer discriminative information among models. The method not only effectively preserves discriminativity from each source model after summation, but also is applicable to source models with non-identical feature dimensionalities. The proposed method achieves accuracies higher or comparable to existing MSFDA methods on various cross-domain object recognition tasks. Further studies are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of aggregating inter-sample relationships, as well as the applicability of proposed method under non-identical source-model feature dimensionalities.",No
iccvw_2023_460,Consistency Regularization for Generalizable Source-free Domain Adaptation.,"Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a well-trained source model to an unlabelled target domain without accessing the source dataset, making it applicable in a variety of real-world scenarios. Existing SFDA methods ONLY assess their adapted models on the target training set, neglecting the data from unseen but identically distributed testing sets. This oversight leads to overfitting issues and constrains the modelâ€™s generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a consistency regularization framework to develop a more generalizable SFDA method, which simultaneously boosts model performance on both target training and testing datasets. Our method leverages soft pseudo-labels generated from weakly augmented images to supervise strongly augmented images, facilitating the model training process and enhancing the generalization ability of the adapted model. To leverage more potentially useful supervision, we present a sampling-based pseudo-label selection strategy, taking samples with severer domain shift into consideration. Moreover, global-oriented calibration methods are introduced to exploit global class distribution and feature cluster information, further improving the adaptation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several SFDA benchmarks, and exhibits robustness on unseen testing datasets.",No
iccvw_2023_461,Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Segmentation as Domain Adaptation.,"Deep learning for unsupervised image segmentation remains challenging due to the absence of human labels. The common idea is to train a segmentation head, with the supervision of pixel-wise pseudo-labels generated based on the representation of self-supervised backbones. By doing so, the model performance depends much on the distance between the distribution of target datasets, and the one of backbonesâ€™ pre-training dataset (e.g., ImageNet). In this work, we investigate a new task, namely unsupervised camouflaged object segmentation (UCOS), where the target objects own a common rarely-seen attribute, i.e., camouflage. Unsurprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art unsupervised models struggle in adapting UCOS, due to the domain gap between the properties of generic and camouflaged objects. To this end, we formulate the UCOS as a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation task (UCOS-DA), where both source labels and target labels are absent during the whole model training process. Specifically, we define a source model consisting of self-supervised vision transformers pre-trained on ImageNet. On the other hand, the target domain includes a simple linear layer (i.e., our target model) and unlabeled camouflaged objects. We then design a pipeline for foreground-background-contrastive self-adversarial domain adaptation, to achieve robust UCOS. As a result, our baseline model achieves superior segmentation performance when compared with competing unsupervised models on the UCOS benchmark, with the training set whichâ€™s scale is only one tenth of the supervised COS counterpart. The UCOS benchmark and our baseline model are now publicly available1.",No
iccvw_2023_462,Class-aware Memory Guided Unbiased Weighting for Universal Domain Adaptive Object Detection.,"Cross-domain object detection aims to align the feature distributions across the source and target domains. Existing cross-domain object detectors typically rely on identical label space assumption, which, however, greatly limits their universality under class gap. This paper introduces Universal Domain Adaptive Object Detection (UDAOD) toward more practical scenarios without any prior knowledge on the category consistency. In the proposed universal setting, the category space is partially intersected (i.e., common classes) between domains. The class gap caused by source-private and target-private classes leads to serious negative transfer and degrades adaptation performance. To this end, we propose a Universal Cross-domain Faster R-CNN (UCF) with a novel unbiased weighting mechanism to effectively measure the common or private classes. Specifically, we propose a dynamic Class-aware Memory (CaM) to overcome the bias of class weights, caused by class incompleteness in a batch of UniDA. We further propose a Weight Surgery Equalization (WSE) to strengthen the polarization of the weights for common and private classes and suppress incorrect alignment. Extensive experiments under the novel UDAOD setting on multiple benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, Clipart, WaterColor, Cityscapes, and FoggyCityscapes are implemented, which shows the SOTA universality of our model.",No
iccvw_2023_463,AD-CLIP: Adapting Domains in Prompt Space Using CLIP.,"Although deep learning models have shown impressive performance on supervised learning tasks, they often struggle to generalize well when the training (source) and test (target) domains differ. Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) has emerged as a popular solution to this problem. However, current DA techniques rely on visual backbones, which may lack semantic richness. Despite the potential of large-scale vision-language foundation models like CLIP, their effectiveness for DA has yet to be fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce AD-CLIP, a domain-agnostic prompt learning strategy for CLIP that aims to solve the DA problem in the prompt space. We leverage the frozen vision backbone of CLIP to extract both image style (domain) and content information, which we apply to learn prompt tokens. Our prompts are designed to be domain-invariant and class-generalizable, by conditioning prompt learning on image style and content features simultaneously. We use standard supervised contrastive learning in the source domain, while proposing an entropy minimization strategy to align domains in the embedding space given the target domain data. We also consider a scenario where only target domain samples are available during testing, without any source domain data, and propose a cross-domain style mapping network to hallucinate domain-agnostic tokens. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark DA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AD-CLIP compared to existing literature.",No
iccvw_2023_464,Raising the Bar on the Evaluation of Out-of-Distribution Detection.,"In image classification, a lot of development has happened in detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) data. However, most OoD detection methods are evaluated on a standard set of datasets, arbitrarily different from training data. There is no clear definition of what forms a ""good"" OoD dataset. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art OoD detection methods already achieve near perfect results on these standard benchmarks. In this paper, we define 2 categories of OoD data using the subtly different concepts of perceptual/visual and semantic similarity to in-distribution (iD) data. We define Near OoD samples as perceptually similar but semantically different from iD samples, and Shifted samples as points which are visually different but semantically akin to iD data. We then propose a GAN based framework for generating OoD samples from each of these 2 categories, given an iD dataset. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, we show that a) state-of-the-art OoD detection methods which perform exceedingly well on conventional benchmarks are significantly less robust to our proposed benchmark. Moreover, we observe that b) models performing well on our setup also perform well on conventional real-world OoD detection benchmarks and vice versa, thereby indicating that one might not even need a separate OoD set, to reliably evaluate performance in OoD detection.",No
iccvw_2023_465,A Re-Parameterized Vision Transformer (ReVT) for Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation.,"The task of semantic segmentation requires a model to assign semantic labels to each pixel of an image. However, the performance of such models degrades when deployed in an unseen domain with different data distributions compared to the training domain. We present a new augmentation-driven approach to domain generalization for semantic segmentation using a re-parameterized vision transformer (ReVT) with weight averaging of multiple models after training. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art mIoU performance of 47.3% (prior art: 46.3%) for small models and of 50.1% (prior art: 47.8%) for midsized models on commonly used benchmark datasets. At the same time, our method requires fewer parameters and reaches a higher frame rate than the best prior art. It is also easy to implement and, unlike network ensembles, does not add any computational complexity during inference.1",No
iccvw_2023_466,LORD: Leveraging Open-Set Recognition with Unknown Data.,"Handling entirely unknown data is a challenge for any deployed classifier. Classification models are typically trained on a static pre-defined dataset and are kept in the dark for the open unassigned feature space. As a result, they struggle to deal with out-of-distribution data during inference. Addressing this task on the class-level is termed open-set recognition (OSR). However, most OSR methods are inherently limited, as they train closed-set classifiers and only adapt the downstream predictions to OSR.This work presents LORD, a framework to Leverage Open-set Recognition by exploiting unknown Data. LORD explicitly models open space during classifier training and provides a systematic evaluation for such approaches. We identify three model-agnostic training strategies that exploit background data and applied them to well-established classifiers. Due to LORDâ€™s extensive evaluation protocol, we consistently demonstrate improved recognition of unknown data. The benchmarks facilitate in-depth analysis across various requirement levels. To mitigate dependency on extensive and costly background datasets, we explore mixup as an off-the-shelf data generation technique. Our experiments highlight mixupâ€™s effectiveness as a substitute for background datasets. Lightweight constraints on mixup synthesis further improve OSR performance.",No
iccvw_2023_467,Masking Strategies for Background Bias Removal in Computer Vision Models.,"Models for fine-grained image classification tasks, where the difference between some classes can be extremely subtle and the number of samples per class tends to be low, are particularly prone to picking up background-related biases and demand robust methods to handle potential examples with out-of-distribution (OOD) backgrounds. To gain deeper insights into this critical problem, our research investigates the impact of background-induced bias on fine-grained image classification, evaluating standard backbone models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). We explore two masking strategies to mitigate background-induced bias: Early masking, which removes background information at the (input) image level, and late masking, which selectively masks high-level spatial features corresponding to the background. Extensive experiments assess the behavior of CNN and ViT models under different masking strategies, with a focus on their generalization to OOD backgrounds. The obtained findings demonstrate that both proposed strategies enhance OOD performance compared to the baseline models, with early masking consistently exhibiting the best OOD performance. Notably, a ViT variant employing GAP-Pooled Patch token-based classification combined with early masking achieves the highest OOD robustness.Our code and models are available at: GitHub",No

We evaluate existing diversity dimensions such as model architecture, model prediction, and neuron activations, as well as a novel diversity dimension of input attribution.Using ResNet50 as a comparison baseline, we evaluate the resiliency of multiple individual DL model architectures against dataset distribution shifts corresponding to natural image corruptions. We compare ensembles created with diverse model architectures trained either independently or through a Neural Architecture Search technique and evaluate the correlation of prediction-based and attribution-based diversity to the final ensemble accuracy.Finally, we evaluate a set of diversity enforcement heuristics for training based on negative correlation learning (NCL) and compare how effective they are to achieve independent failure behavior.Our key observations are: 1) model architecture is more important for individual resiliency than model size or model accuracy but architecture diversity in an ensemble is typically not more resilient, 2) attribution-based diversity is less negatively correlated to the ensemble accuracy than prediction-based diversity, 3) a balanced loss function of individual and ensemble accuracy creates more resilient ensembles for image natural corruptions, 4) architecture diversity produces more diversity than NCL in all explored diversity metrics: predictions, attributions, and activations.",No
iccvw_2023_469,DatasetEquity: Are All Samples Created Equal? In The Quest For Equity Within Datasets.,"Data imbalance is a well-known issue in the field of machine learning, attributable to the cost of data collection, the difficulty of labeling, and the geographical distribution of the data. In computer vision, bias in data distribution caused by image appearance remains highly unexplored. Compared to categorical distributions using class labels, image appearance reveals complex relationships between objects beyond what class labels provide. Clustering deep perceptual features extracted from raw pixels gives a richer representation of the data. This paper presents a novel method for addressing data imbalance in machine learning. The method computes sample likelihoods based on image appearance using deep perceptual embeddings and clustering. It then uses these likelihoods to weigh samples differently during training with a proposed Generalized Focal Loss function. This loss can be easily integrated with deep learning algorithms. Experiments validate the methodâ€™s effectiveness across autonomous driving vision datasets including KITTI and nuScenes. The loss function improves state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods, achieving over 200% AP gains on under-represented classes (Cyclist) in the KITTI dataset. The results demonstrate the method is generalizable, complements existing techniques, and is particularly beneficial for smaller datasets and rare classes.

iccvw_2023_470,Benchmarking Image Classifiers for Physical Out-of-Distribution Examples Detection.,"The rising popularity of deep neural networks (DNNs) in computer vision has raised concerns about their robustness in the real world. Recent works in this field have well-demonstrated the vulnerability of these networks to carefully crafted adversarial attacks which yield out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Interestingly, the majority of the existing literature focuses on adversarial attacks crafted for the digital domain only. Physical adversarial attacks are easier to deploy in the real world and yield higher attack success than digital perturbations. The prime limitation of such a dearth of studies handling physical out-of-distribution images is the lack of benchmark datasets. To overcome this limitation, this research proposes a novel out-of-distribution dataset using adversarial patches of different variations to advance the robustness of deep networks against such stealthy out-of-distribution images. We have also conducted extensive experiments both under seen and unseen patch settings and observed that unseen adversarial patches are hard to defend. By conducting this study and delving into the complexities of defending against patch attacks, we believe it will serve as inspiration for future researchers to incorporate physical OOD attacks into their defense strategies.",Yes
iccvw_2023_471,Gradient Estimation for Unseen Domain Risk Minimization with Pre-Trained Models.,"Domain generalization aims to build generalized models that perform well on unseen domains when only source domains are available for model optimization. Recent studies have shown that large-scale pre-trained models can enhance domain generalization by leveraging their generalization power. However, these pre-trained models lack target task-specific knowledge yet due to discrepancies between the pre-training objectives and the target task. Although the task-specific knowledge could be learned from source domains by fine-tuning, this hurts the generalization power of pre-trained models due to gradient bias toward the source domains. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new domain generalization method that estimates unobservable gradients that reduce potential risks in unseen domains using a large-scale pre-trained model. These estimated unobservable gradients allow the pre-trained model to learn task-specific knowledge further while preserving its generalization ability by relieving the gradient bias. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms baseline methods on DOMAINBED, a standard benchmark in domain generalization. We also provide extensive analyses to demonstrate that the pre-trained model can learn task-specific knowledge without sacrificing its generalization power.",No

Our approach involves training a Convolutional Autoencoder to reconstruct attention heatmaps produced by a ViT classifier, enabling accurate image reconstruction and effective OOD detection. Moreover, our method does not require additional labels during training, ensuring efficiency and ease of implementation. We validate our approach on a standard OOD benchmark using CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. To test OOD in a real-world setting we also collected a novel dataset: WildCapture.

iccvw_2023_473,SC 2 GAN: Rethinking Entanglement by Self-correcting Correlated GAN Space.,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize realistic images, with the learned latent space shown to encode rich semantic information with various interpretable directions. However, due to the unstructured nature of the learned latent space, it inherits the bias from the training data where specific groups of visual attributes that are not causally related tend to appear together, a phenomenon also known as spurious correlations, e.g., age and eyeglasses or women and lipsticks. Consequently, the learned distribution often lacks the proper modelling of the missing examples. The interpolation following editing directions for one attribute could result in entangled changes with other attributes. To address this problem, previous works typically adjust the learned directions to minimize the changes in other attributes, yet they still fail on strongly correlated features. In this work, we study the entanglement issue in both the training data and the learned latent space for the StyleGAN2-FFHQ model. We propose a novel framework SC2GAN that achieves disentanglement by re-projecting low-density latent code samples in the original latent space and correcting the editing directions based on both the high-density and low-density regions. By leveraging the original meaningful directions and semantic region-specific layers, our framework interpolates the original latent codes to generate images with attribute combination that appears infrequently, then inverts these samples back to the original latent space. We apply our framework to pre-existing methods that learn meaningful latent directions and showcase its strong capability to disentangle the attributes with small amounts of low-density region samples added.",No

Robustness in vision machine learning ensures reliable and consistent performance, enhancing generalization, adaptability, and resistance to noise, variations, and adversarial attacks. Self-supervised representation learning paradigms, namely contrastive learning, knowledge distillation, mutual information maximization, and clustering, have been considered to have shown advances in invariant learning representations. This work investigates the robustness of learned representations of SSL approaches focusing on distribution shifts and image corruptions in computer vision. Detailed experiments have been conducted to study the robustness of SSL methods on distribution shifts and image corruptions. The empirical analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between the performance of learned representations within SSL paradigms and the severity of distribution shifts and corruptions. Notably, higher levels of shifts and corruptions are found to significantly diminish the robustness of the learned representations. These findings highlight the critical impact of distribution shifts and image corruptions on the performance and resilience of SSL methods, emphasizing the need for effective strategies to mitigate their adverse effects. The study strongly advocates for future research in the field of self-supervised representation learning to prioritize the key aspects of safety and robustness in order to ensure practical applicability.

iccvw_2023_475,Far Away in the Deep Space: Dense Nearest-Neighbor-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection.,"The key to out-of-distribution detection is density estimation of the in-distribution data or of its feature representations. This is particularly challenging for dense anomaly detection in domains where the in-distribution data has a complex underlying structure. Nearest-Neighbors approaches have been shown to work well in object-centric data domains, such as industrial inspection and image classification. In this paper, we show that nearest-neighbor approaches also yield state-of-the-art results on dense novelty detection in complex driving scenes when working with an appropriate feature representation. In particular, we find that transformer-based architectures produce representations that yield much better similarity metrics for the task. We identify the multi-head structure of these models as one of the reasons, and demonstrate a way to transfer some of the improvements to CNNs. Ultimately, the approach is simple and non-invasive, i.e., it does not affect the primary segmentation performance, refrains from training on examples of anomalies, and achieves state-of-the-art results on RoadAnomaly, StreetHazards, and SegmentMeIfYouCan-Anomaly.",No

In this paper, we present a lightweight and high-performance regularization method for Mahalanobis distance (MD)-based uncertainty prediction, and that requires minimal changes to the networkâ€™s architecture. To derive Gaussian latent representation favourable for MD calculation, we introduce a self-supervised representation learning method that separates in-class representations into multiple Gaussians. Classes with non-Gaussian representations are automatically identified and dynamically clustered into multiple new classes that are approximately Gaussian. Evaluation on standard OOD benchmarks shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on OOD detection and is very competitive on predictive probability calibration.

Addressing this challenge, we present an adaptation of the Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) framework - an approach exploiting the overparameterization of deep neural networks - for pixel-wise regression tasks. Our MIMO variant expands the applicability of the approach from simple image classification to broader computer vision domains. For that purpose, we adapted the U-Net architecture to train multiple subnetworks within a single model, harnessing the overparameterization in deep neural networks.

Most of the existing OOD detection solutions focus on improving the OOD robustness of a classification model trained exclusively on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we take a different approach and propose to leverage generic pre-trained representation. We propose a novel OOD method, called GROOD, that formulates the OOD detection as a Neyman-Pearson task with well calibrated scores and which achieves excellent performance, predicated by the use of a good generic representation. Only a trivial training process is required for adapting GROOD to a particular problem. The method is simple, general, efficient, calibrated and with only a few hyper-parameters.

Though LiDAR sensor is known for its precise range measurement, the non-uniform and uncertain point sampling density induce structural inconsistencies. Hence, existing supervised and unsupervised point set registration methods fail to establish one-to-one matching correspondences between LiDAR frames. We introduce a novel deep learning-based real-time (âˆ¼35-40ms per frame) LO method that jointly learns accurate frame-to-frame correspondences and modelâ€™s predictive uncertainty (PU) as evidence to safe-guard LO predictions. In this work, we propose (i) partial optimal transportation of LiDAR feature descriptor for robust LO estimation, (ii) joint learning of predictive uncertainty while learning odometry over driving sequences, and (iii) demonstrate how PU can serve as evidence for necessary pose-graph optimization when LO network is either under or over confident.

iccvw_2023_480,Dual-level Interaction for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation.,"Self-training approach recently secures its position in domain adaptive semantic segmentation, where a model is trained with target domain pseudo-labels. Current advances have mitigated noisy pseudo-labels resulting from the domain gap. However, they still struggle with erroneous pseudo-labels near the boundaries of the semantic classifier. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a dual-level interaction for domain adaptation (DIDA) in semantic segmentation. Explicitly, we encourage the different augmented views of the same pixel to have not only similar class prediction (semantic-level) but also akin similarity relationship with respect to other pixels (instance-level). As itâ€™s impossible to keep features of all pixel instances for a dataset, we, therefore, maintain a labeled instance bank with dynamic updating strategies to selectively store the informative features of instances. Further, DIDA performs cross-level interaction with scattering and gathering techniques to regenerate more reliable pseudo-labels.

Estimating pixel-wise uncertainties for the depth input of dense SLAM methods allows re-weighing the tracking and mapping losses towards image regions that contain more suitable information that is more reliable for SLAM.

We further discuss the advantages of the uncertainty learning for the case of multi-sensor input. Extensive analysis, experimentation, and ablations show that our proposed modeling paradigm improves both mapping and tracking accuracy and often performs better than alternatives that require ground truth depth or 3D. Our experiments show that we achieve a 38% and 27% lower absolute trajectory tracking error (ATE) on the 7-Scenes and TUM-RGBD datasets respectively. On the popular Replica dataset using two types of depth sensors, we report an 11% F1-score improvement on RGBD SLAM compared to the recent state-of-the-art neural implicit approaches.

Recently, several solutions were proposed to tackle this problem, most leveraging model predictions or softmax confidence to derive accuracy estimates. However, under dataset shifts confidence scores may become ill-calibrated if samples are too far from the training distribution. In this work, we show that taking into account distances of test samples to their expected training distribution can significantly improve performance estimation under covariate shift. Precisely, we introduce a ""distance-check"" to flag samples that lie too far from the expected distribution, to avoid relying on their untrustworthy model outputs in the accuracy estimation step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on 13 image classification tasks, across a wide-range of natural and synthetic distribution shifts and hundreds of models, with a median relative MAE improvement of 27% over the best baseline across all tasks, and SOTA performance on 10 out of 13 tasks.

iccvw_2023_483,Identifying Out-of-Domain Objects with Dirichlet Deep Neural Networks.,"Deep neural networks are usually trained on a closed set of classes, which makes them distrustful when handling previously-unseen out-of-domain (OOD) objects. In safety-critical applications such as perception for automated driving, detecting and localizing OOD objects is crucial, especially if they are positioned in the driving path. In the context of this contribution, OOD objects refer to objects that were not represented in the training dataset. We propose a Dirichlet deep neural network for instance segmentation with inherent uncertainty modeling based on Dirichlet distributions and the Intermediate Layer Variational Inference (ILVI). A thorough analysis shows that our method delivers reliable uncertainty estimates to its predictions whilst identifying OOD instances. The model-agnostic approach can be applied to different instance segmentation models as demonstrated for two different state-of-the-art deep neural networks.

iccvw_2023_484,A Simple and Explainable Method for Uncertainty Estimation using Attribute Prototype Networks.,"Deep learningâ€™s utility in applications like medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, and natural language processing often hinges on the accurate estimation of uncertainty. Yet, conventional methods for uncertainty estimation face challenges, including high computational cost, difficulties with scalability, or poor interpretability. This paper presents a novel approach to uncertainty estimation using Attribute Prototype Networks (APNs), a method designed for learning robust and interpretable data representations. By leveraging prototype similarity scores, we propose a straightforward way to quantify the uncertainty of predictions, providing explainability and introducing a new technique for detecting out-of-distribution samples based on the distance to the nearest prototype. Our experiments demonstrate that this method offers valuable uncertainty information across several datasets. Our research opens up a new avenue for uncertainty estimation in deep learning, providing a simpler and more explainable solution.",No
iccvw_2023_485,Biased Class disagreement: detection of out of distribution instances by using differently biased semantic segmentation models.,"Autonomous driving heavily relies on accurate understanding of the surrounding environment, which is facilitated by semantic segmentation models that classify each pixel in an image. However, training these computer vision models using available datasets often fails to capture the diverse conditions and objects that can be encountered during a trip. Adverse weather conditions and the presence of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) instances, such as wild animals and debris, are common challenges in autonomous driving. Unfortunately, current models struggle to perform well in unseen conditions.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a comprehensive approach that integrates uncertainty quantification and bias reinforcing within the framework of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Our approach leverages multiple models with diverse biases, aiming to assign high-confidence predictions to OOD instances by mapping them to the selected prior semantic category. Extensive evaluations on the MUAD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving performance and robustness against OOD instances. Notably, our approach achieves outstanding results, securing the first position in the MUAD challenge.",No
iccvw_2023_486,Exploring Inlier and Outlier Specification for Improved Medical OOD Detection.,"We address the crucial task of developing well-calibrated out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors, in order to enable safe deployment of medical image classifiers. Calibration enables deep networks to protect against trivial decision rules and controls over-generalization, thereby supporting model reliability. Given the challenges involved in curating appropriate calibration datasets, synthetic augmentations have gained significant popularity for inlier/outlier specification. Despite the rapid progress in data augmentation techniques, our study reveals a remarkable finding: the synthesis space and augmentation type play a pivotal role in effectively calibrating OOD detectors. Using the popular energy-based OOD detection framework, we find that the optimal protocol is to synthesize latent-space inliers along with diverse pixel-space outliers. Through extensive empirical studies conducted on multiple medical imaging benchmarks, we consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving substantial improvements of 15% - 35% in AUROC compared to the state-of-the-art across various open-set recognition settings.",No
iccvw_2023_487,Adversarial Attacks Against Uncertainty Quantification.,"Machine-learning models can be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., carefully-crafted input perturbations that force models to output wrong predictions. While uncertainty quantification has been recently proposed to detect adversarial inputs, under the assumption that such attacks exhibit a higher prediction uncertainty than pristine data, it has been shown that adaptive attacks specifically aimed at reducing also the uncertainty estimate can easily bypass this defense mechanism. In this work, we focus on a different adversarial scenario in which the attacker is still interested in manipulating the uncertainty estimate, but regardless of the correctness of the prediction; in particular, the goal is to undermine the use of machine-learning models when their outputs are consumed by a downstream module or by a human operator. Following such direction, we: (i) design a threat model for attacks targeting uncertainty quantification; (ii) devise different attack strategies on conceptually different UQ techniques spanning for both classification and semantic segmentation problems; (iii) conduct a first complete and extensive analysis to compare the differences between some of the most employed UQ approaches under attack. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our attacks are more effective in manipulating uncertainty quantification measures than attacks aimed to also induce misclassifications.",Yes
iccvw_2023_488,Unsupervised Confidence Approximation: Trustworthy Learning from Noisy Labelled Data.,"Training neural networks with noisy labels presents a challenge due to inherent errors in label annotations. Concurrently, selectively predicting outputs from neural networks involves identifying confidently predicted results. These challenges are particularly important in the medical domain, as they often occur jointly. Existing techniques address either the training of models with noisy labels or the task of selective prediction in isolation, often neglecting their intrinsic interdependence. We establish a relationship between these challenges and propose a novel framework called Unsupervised Confidence Approximation (UCA) to address them simultaneously. UCA facilitates the concurrent training of neural networks for a main task such as image segmentation and classification while also predicting confidence levels. This is all done while accommodating datasets containing noisy labels. Remarkably, UCA operates autonomously, eliminating the need for labelled confidence information and qualifying as an unsupervised solution. Furthermore, UCA is versatile, integrating with diverse network architectures. Our evaluation of UCAâ€™s efficacy covers the general CIFAR-10N dataset as well as the medical image datasets CheXpert and Gleason-2019. In our experiments, incorporating UCA into existing networks enhances performance in both aspects of noisy label training and selective prediction. Moreover, networks equipped with UCA demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods for noisy label training when operating in the conventional full coverage mode. By design, these UCA-equipped networks incorporate a risk-management mechanism, as evidenced by flawless risk-coverage curves. Additionally, UCA-equipped networks outperform existing selective prediction techniques, leading to substantial performance improvements and reinforcing its utility and impact within the context of trustworthy medical deep learning.",No

iccvw_2023_490,What If the TV Was Off? Examining Counterfactual Reasoning Abilities of Multi-modal Language Models.,"Counterfactual reasoning ability is one of the core abilities of human intelligence. This reasoning process involves the processing of alternatives to observed states or past events, and this process can improve our ability for planning and decision-making. In this work, we focus on benchmarking the counterfactual reasoning ability of multimodal large language models. We take the question and answer pairs from the VQAv2 dataset and add one counterfactual presupposition to the questions, with the answer being modified accordingly. After generating counterfactual questions and answers using ChatGPT, we manually examine all generated questions and answers to ensure correctness. This results in over 2k counterfactual question and answer pairs. We evaluate recent vision language models on our newly collected test dataset and found that all models exhibit a large performance drop compared to the results tested on questions without counterfactual presupposition. This result indicates that there still exists space for developing vision language models. We hope our proposed benchmark can help the development of future systems.",No
iccvw_2023_491,Uni-NLX: Unifying Textual Explanations for Vision and Vision-Language Tasks.,"Natural Language Explanations (NLE) aim at supplementing the prediction of a model with human-friendly natural text. Existing NLE approaches involve training separate models for each downstream task. In this work, we propose Uni-NLX, a unified framework that consolidates all NLE tasks into a single and compact multi-task model using a unified training objective of text generation. Additionally, we introduce two new NLE datasets: 1) ImageNetX, a dataset of 144K samples for explaining ImageNet categories, and 2) VQA-ParaX, a dataset of 123K samples for explaining the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA). Both datasets are derived leveraging large language models (LLMs). By training on the 1M combined NLE samples, our single unified framework is capable of simultaneously performing seven NLE tasks including VQA, visual recognition and visual reasoning tasks with 7Ã— fewer parameters, demonstrating comparable performance to the independent task-specific models in previous approaches, and in certain tasks even outperforming them.1",No
iccvw_2023_492,SelfGraphVQA: A Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network for Scene-based Question Answering.,"The intersection of vision and language is of major interest due to the increased focus on seamless integration between recognition and reasoning. Scene graphs (SGs) have emerged as a useful tool for multimodal image analysis, showing impressive performance in tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). In this work, we demonstrate that despite the effectiveness of scene graphs in VQA tasks, current methods that utilize idealized annotated scene graphs struggle to generalize when using predicted scene graphs extracted from images. To address this issue, we introduce the SelfGraphVQA framework. Our approach extracts a scene graph from an input image using a pretrained scene graph generator and employs semantically-preserving augmentation with self-supervised techniques. This method improves the utilization of graph representations in VQA tasks by circumventing the need for costly and potentially biased annotated data. By creating alternative views of the extracted graphs through image augmentations, we can learn joint embeddings by optimizing the informational content in their representations using an un-normalized contrastive approach. As we work with SGs, we experiment with three distinct maximization strategies: node-wise, graph-wise, and permutation-equivariant regularization. We empirically showcase the effectiveness of the extracted scene graph for VQA and demonstrate that these approaches enhance overall performance by highlighting the significance of visual information. This offers a more practical solution for VQA tasks that rely on SGs for complex reasoning questions.",No
iccvw_2023_493,Understanding Video Scenes through Text: Insights from Text-based Video Question Answering.,"Researchers have extensively studied the field of vision and language, discovering that both visual and textual content is crucial for understanding scenes effectively. Particularly, comprehending text in videos holds great significance, requiring both scene text understanding and temporal reasoning. This paper focuses on exploring two recently introduced datasets, NewsVideoQA and M4-ViteVQA, which aim to address video question answering based on textual content. The NewsVideoQA dataset contains question-answer pairs related to the text in news videos, while M4-ViteVQA comprises question-answer pairs from diverse categories like vlogging, traveling, and shopping. We provide an analysis of the formulation of these datasets on various levels, exploring the degree of visual understanding and multi-frame comprehension required for answering the questions. Additionally, the study includes experimentation with BERT-QA, a text-only model, which demonstrates comparable performance to the original methods on both datasets, indicating the shortcomings in the formulation of these datasets. Furthermore, we also look into the domain adaptation aspect by examining the effectiveness of training on M4-ViteVQA and evaluating on NewsVideoQA and vice-versa, thereby shedding light on the challenges and potential benefits of out-of-domain training.",No
iccvw_2023_494,Iterative Robust Visual Grounding with Masked Reference based Centerpoint Supervision.,"Visual Grounding (VG) aims at localizing target objects from an image based on given expressions and has made significant progress with the development of detection and vision transformer. However, existing VG methods tend to generate false-alarm objects when presented with inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions, which commonly occur in practical applications. Moreover, existing methods fail to capture fine-grained features, accurate localization, and sufficient context comprehension from the whole image and textual descriptions. To address both issues, we propose an Iterative Robust Visual Grounding (IRVG) framework with Masked Reference based Centerpoint Supervision (MRCS). The framework introduces iterative multi-level vision-language fusion (IMVF) for better alignment. We use MRCS to ahieve more accurate localization with point-wised feature supervision. Then, to improve the robustness of VG, we also present a multi-stage false-alarm sensitive decoder (MFSD) to prevent the generation of false-alarm objects when presented with inaccurate expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IR-VG achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, with improvements of 25% and 10% compared to existing SOTA approaches on the two newly proposed robust VG datasets. Moreover, the proposed framework is also verified effective on five regular VG datasets. Codes and models will be publicly at https://github.com/cv516Buaa/IR-VG.",No
iccvw_2023_495,MMTF: Multi-Modal Temporal Fusion for Commonsense Video Question Answering.,"Video question answering is a challenging task that requires understanding the video and question in the same context. This becomes even harder when the questions involve reasoning, such as predicting future events or explaining counterfactual events, because they need knowledge not explicitly shown. Existing methods use coarse-grained fusion of video and language features, ignoring temporal information. To address this, we propose a novel vision-text fusion module that learns the temporal context of the video and question. Our module expands question tokens along the videoâ€™s temporal axis and fuses them with video features to generate new representations with local and global context. We evaluated our method on four VideoQA datasets, including MSVD-QA, NExT-QA, Causal-VidQA, and AGQA-2.0.",No
iccvw_2023_496,Pointing out Human Answer Mistakes in a Goal-Oriented Visual Dialogue.,"Effective communication between humans and intelligent agents has promising applications for solving complex problems. One such approach is visual dialogue, which leverages multimodal context to assist humans. However, real-world scenarios occasionally involve human mistakes, which can cause intelligent agents to fail. While most prior research assumes perfect answers from human interlocutors, we focus on a setting where the agent points out unintentional mistakes for the interlocutor to review, better reflecting real-world situations. In this paper, we show that human answer mistakes depend on question type and QA turn in the visual dialogue by analyzing a previously unused data collection of human mistakes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of those factors for the modelâ€™s accuracy in a pointing-human-mistake task through experiments using a simple MLP model and a Visual Language Model.",No

iccvw_2023_498,CLIP-Decoder : ZeroShot Multilabel Classification using Multimodal CLIP Aligned Representations.,"Multi-label classification is an essential task utilized in a wide variety of real-world applications. Multi-label zero-shot learning is a method for classifying images into multiple unseen categories for which no training data is available, while in general zero-shot situations, the test set may include observed classes. The CLIP-Decoder is a novel method based on the state-of-the-art ML-Decoder attention-based head. We introduce multi-modal representation learning in CLIP-Decoder, utilizing the text encoder to extract text features and the image encoder for image feature extraction. Furthermore, we minimize semantic mismatch by aligning image and word embeddings in the same dimension and comparing their respective representations using a combined loss, which comprises classification loss and CLIP loss. This strategy outperforms other methods and we achieve cutting-edge results on zero-shot multilabel classification tasks using CLIP-Decoder. Our method achieves an absolute increase of 3.9% in performance compared to existing methods for zero-shot learning multi-label classification tasks. Additionally, in the generalized zero-shot learning multi-label classification task, our method shows an impressive increase of almost 2.3%.",No
