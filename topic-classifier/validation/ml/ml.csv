In particular, we study how to design a personalized curriculum over demonstrations to speed up the learner's convergence. We provide a unified curriculum strategy for two popular learner models: Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt-IRL) and Cross-Entropy Behavioral Cloning (CrossEnt-BC). Our unified strategy induces a ranking over demonstrations based on a notion of difficulty scores computed w.r.t. the teacher's optimal policy and the learner's current policy. Compared to the state of the art, our strategy doesn't require access to the learner's internal dynamics and still enjoys similar convergence guarantees under mild technical conditions. Furthermore, we adapt our curriculum strategy to the setting where no teacher agent is present using task-specific difficulty scores. Experiments on a synthetic car driving environment and navigation-based environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our curriculum strategy.

1,aaai_2020_777,Towards Certificated Model Robustness Against Weight Perturbations.,"This work studies the sensitivity of neural networks to weight perturbations, firstly corresponding to a newly developed threat model that perturbs the neural network parameters. We propose an efficient approach to compute a certified robustness bound of weight perturbations, within which neural networks will not make erroneous outputs as desired by the adversary. In addition, we identify a useful connection between our developed certification method and the problem of weight quantization, a popular model compression technique in deep neural networks (DNNs) and a ‘must-try’ step in the design of DNN inference engines on resource constrained computing platforms, such as mobiles, FPGA, and ASIC. Specifically, we study the problem of weight quantization – weight perturbations in the non-adversarial setting – through the lens of certificated robustness, and we demonstrate significant improvements on the generalization ability of quantized networks through our robustness-aware quantization scheme.",Yes

Thus, the robustness of 3D deep learning models against adversarial attacks becomes a major consideration. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of various self-supervised learning proxy tasks on different architectures and threat models for 3D point clouds with adversarial training. Specifically, we study MLP-based (PointNet), convolution-based (DGCNN), and transformer-based (PCT) 3D architectures. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that appropriate applications of self-supervision can significantly enhance the robustness in 3D point cloud recognition, achieving considerable improvements compared to the standard adversarial training baseline. Our analysis reveals that local feature learning is desirable for adversarial robustness in point clouds since it limits the adversarial propagation between the point-level input perturbations and the model's final output. This insight also explains the success of DGCNN and the jigsaw proxy task in achieving stronger 3D adversarial robustness.

4,icml_2021_231,Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Random Deep Neural Networks.,"The reliability of deep learning algorithms is fundamentally challenged by the existence of adversarial examples, which are incorrectly classified inputs that are extremely close to a correctly classified input. We explore the properties of adversarial examples for deep neural networks with random weights and biases, and prove that for any p≥1, the \ell^p distance of any given input from the classification boundary scales as one over the square root of the dimension of the input times the \ell^p norm of the input. The results are based on the recently proved equivalence between Gaussian processes and deep neural networks in the limit of infinite width of the hidden layers, and are validated with experiments on both random deep neural networks and deep neural networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. The results constitute a fundamental advance in the theoretical understanding of adversarial examples, and open the way to a thorough theoretical characterization of the relation between network architecture and robustness to adversarial perturbations.",Yes
5,icml_2023_565,Make-An-Audio: Text-To-Audio Generation with Prompt-Enhanced Diffusion Models.,"Large-scale multimodal generative modeling has created milestones in text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Its application to audio still lags behind for two main reasons: the lack of large-scale datasets with high-quality text-audio pairs, and the complexity of modeling long continuous audio data. In this work, we propose Make-An-Audio with a prompt-enhanced diffusion model that addresses these gaps by 1) introducing pseudo prompt enhancement with a distill-then-reprogram approach, it alleviates data scarcity with orders of magnitude concept compositions by using language-free audios; 2) leveraging spectrogram autoencoder to predict the self-supervised audio representation instead of waveforms. Together with robust contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) representations, Make-An-Audio achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective benchmark evaluation. Moreover, we present its controllability and generalization for X-to-Audio with ""No Modality Left Behind"", for the first time unlocking the ability to generate high-definition, high-fidelity audios given a user-defined modality input.

6,icml_2020_583,Min-Max Optimization without Gradients: Convergence and Applications to Black-Box Evasion and Poisoning Attacks.,"In this paper, we study the problem of constrained min-max optimization in a black-box setting, where the desired optimizer cannot access the gradients of the objective function but may query its values. We present a principled optimization framework, integrating a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient estimator with an alternating projected stochastic gradient descent-ascent method, where the former only requires a small number of function queries and the later needs just one-step descent/ascent update. We show that the proposed framework, referred to as ZO-Min-Max, has a sublinear convergence rate under mild conditions and scales gracefully with problem size. We also explore a promising connection between black-box min-max optimization and black-box evasion and poisoning attacks in adversarial machine learning (ML). Our empirical evaluations on these use cases demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its scalability to dimensions that prohibit using recent black-box solvers.",Yes
7,icml_2023_1821,Surrogate Model Extension (SME): A Fast and Accurate Weight Update Attack on Federated Learning.,"In Federated Learning (FL) and many other distributed training frameworks, collaborators can hold their private data locally and only share the network weights trained with the local data after multiple iterations. Gradient inversion is a family of privacy attacks that recovers data from its generated gradients. Seemingly, FL can provide a degree of protection against gradient inversion attacks on weight updates, since the gradient of a single step is concealed by the accumulation of gradients over multiple local iterations. In this work, we propose a principled way to extend gradient inversion attacks to weight updates in FL, thereby better exposing weaknesses in the presumed privacy protection inherent in FL. In particular, we propose a surrogate model method based on the characteristic of two-dimensional gradient flow and low-rank property of local updates. Our method largely boosts the ability of gradient inversion attacks on weight updates containing many iterations and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, our method runs up to100×faster than the SOTA baseline in the common FL scenario. Our work re-evaluates and highlights the privacy risk of sharing network weights.

8,iccvw_2021_416,Unravelling the Effect of Image Distortions for Biased Prediction of Pre-trained Face Recognition Models.,"Identifying and mitigating bias in deep learning algorithms has gained significant popularity in the past few years due to its impact on the society. Researchers argue that models trained on balanced datasets with good representation provide equal and unbiased performance across subgroups. However, can seemingly unbiased pre-trained model become biased when input data undergoes certain distortions? For the first time, we attempt to answer this question in the context of face recognition. We provide a systematic analysis to evaluate the performance of four state-of-the-art deep face recognition models in the presence of image distortions across different gender and race subgroups. We have observed that image distortions have a relationship with the performance gap of the model across different subgroups.",Yes
9,icml_2023_959,Iterative Approximate Cross-Validation.,"Cross-validation (CV) is one of the most popular tools for assessing and selecting predictive models. However, standard CV suffers from high computational cost when the number of folds is large. Recently, under the empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework, a line of works proposed efficient methods to approximate CV based on the solution of the ERM problem trained on the full dataset. However, in large-scale problems, it can be hard to obtain the exact solution of the ERM problem, either due to limited computational resources or due to early stopping as a way of preventing overfitting. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to efficiently approximate CV when the ERM problem is solved via an iterative first-order algorithm, without running until convergence. Our new method extends existing guarantees for CV approximation to hold along the whole trajectory of the algorithm, including at convergence, thus generalizing existing CV approximation methods. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method through a range of empirical studies.",No

Incomplete 3D geometry information can negatively affect the performance of learning-based grasp detection methods, and scanning the scene from multiple views introduces significant time costs. To achieve reliable grasping performance with efficient camera movement, we propose an active grasp detection framework based on the Neural Graspness Field (NGF), which models the scene incrementally and facilitates next-best-view planning. Constructed in real-time as the camera moves, the NGF effectively models the grasp distribution in 3D space by rendering graspness predictions from each view. For next-best-view planning, we aim to reduce the uncertainty of the NGF through a graspness inconsistency-guided policy, selecting views based on discrepancies between NGF outputs and a pre-trained graspness network. Additionally, we present a neural graspness sampling method that decodes graspness values from the NGF to improve grasp pose detection results. Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to previous works. Real-world experiments show that our method achieves a superior trade-off between grasping performance and time costs.

11,icml_2022_114,Burst-Dependent Plasticity and Dendritic Amplification Support Target-Based Learning and Hierarchical Imitation Learning.,"The brain can learn to solve a wide range of tasks with high temporal and energetic efficiency. However, most biological models are composed of simple single-compartment neurons and cannot achieve the state-of-the-art performances of artificial intelligence. We propose a multi-compartment model of pyramidal neuron, in which bursts and dendritic input segregation give the possibility to plausibly support a biological target-based learning. In target-based learning, the internal solution of a problem (a spatio-temporal pattern of bursts in our case) is suggested to the network, bypassing the problems of error backpropagation and credit assignment. Finally, we show that this neuronal architecture naturally supports the orchestration of “hierarchical imitation learning”, enabling the decomposition of challenging long-horizon decision-making tasks into simpler subtasks.",No
12,iccvw_2021_50,CMC-COV19D: Contrastive Mixup Classification for COVID-19 Diagnosis.,"Deep learning methods have been extensively investigated for rapid and precise computer-aided diagnosis during the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. However, there are still remaining issues to be addressed, such as distinguishing COVID-19 in the complex scenario of multi-type pneumonia classification. In this paper, we aim to boost the COVID-19 diagnostic performance with more discriminative deep representations of COVID and non-COVID categories. We propose a novel COVID-19 diagnosis approach with contrastive representation learning to effectively capture the intra-class similarity and inter-class difference. Besides, we design an adaptive joint training strategy to integrate the classification loss, mixup loss, and contrastive loss. Through the joint loss function, we obtain the high-level representations which are highly discriminative in COVID-19 screening. Extensive experiments on two chest CT image datasets, i.e., CC-CCII dataset and COV19-CT-DB database, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in COVID-19 diagnosis.

Existing methods solve this problem from either a bag classification or an instance classification perspective. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end weakly supervised knowledge distillation framework (WENO) for WSI classification, which integrates a bag classifier and an instance classifier in a knowledge distillation framework to mutually improve the performance of both classifiers. Specifically, an attention-based bag classifier is used as the teacher network, which is trained with weak bag labels, and an instance classifier is used as the student network, which is trained using the normalized attention scores obtained from the teacher network as soft pseudo labels for the instances in positive bags. An instance feature extractor is shared between the teacher and the student to further enhance the knowledge exchange between them. In addition, we propose a hard positive instance mining strategy based on the output of the student network to force the teacher network to keep mining hard positive instances.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage graph embedding technique based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to identify DNN topologies and use reinforcement learning (RL) to find a suitable compression policy. We performed resource-constrained (i.e., FLOPs) channel pruning and compared our approach with state-of-the-art model compression methods. We evaluated our method on various models from typical to mobile-friendly networks, such as ResNet family, VGG-16, MobileNet-v1/v2, and ShuffleNet.

However, the untrustworthy nature of third-party ML services poses backdoor threats. Existing defenses in MLaaS are limited by their reliance on training samples or white-box model analysis, highlighting the need for a black-box backdoor purification method. In our paper, we attempt to use diffusion models for purification by introducing noise in a forward diffusion process to destroy backdoors and recover clean samples through a reverse generative process. However, since a higher noise also destroys the semantics of the original samples, it still results in a low restoration performance. To investigate the effectiveness of noise in eliminating different types of backdoors, we conducted a preliminary study, which demonstrates that backdoors with low visibility can be easily destroyed by lightweight noise and those with high visibility need to be destroyed by high noise but can be easily detected. Based on the study, we propose SampDetox, which strategically combines lightweight and high noise. SampDetox applies weak noise to eliminate low-visibility backdoors and compares the structural similarity between the recovered and original samples to localize high-visibility backdoors. Intensive noise is then applied to these localized areas, destroying the high-visibility backdoors while preserving global semantic information. As a result, detoxified samples can be used for inference, even by poisoned models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SampDetox in defending against various state-of-the-art backdoor attacks.

Measuring the relative contributions of agents and allocating them shares of the reward that promote long-lasting cooperation are difficult tasks. Cooperative game theory offers solution concepts identifying distribution schemes, such as the Shapley value, that fairly reflect the contribution of individuals to the performance of the team or the Core, which reduces the incentive of agents to abandon their team. Applications of such methods include identifying influential features and sharing the costs of joint ventures or team formation. Unfortunately, using these solutions requires tackling a computational barrier as they are hard to compute, even in restricted settings. In this work, we show how cooperative game-theoretic solutions can be distilled into a learned model by training neural networks to propose fair and stable payoff allocations. We show that our approach creates models that can generalize to games far from the training distribution and can predict solutions for more players than observed during training. An important application of our framework is Explainable AI: our approach can be used to speed-up Shapley value computations on many instances.

18,iccvw_2023_239,Topo-CXR: Chest X-ray TB and Pneumonia Screening with Topological Machine Learning.,"Examination of chest X-ray images is currently one of the most important methods for the screening and diagnosis of thoracic diseases and, in some cases, for assessing response to treatment. However, this task is time-consuming and expensive as it requires a detailed visual inspection and interpretation by a trained clinician. In the past decade, several machine learning (ML) methods have been developed to remedy this issue as clinical decision support methods. However, most of these algorithms face challenges like computational feasibility, reliability, and interoperability.In this paper, we develop a unique feature extraction method for chest X-rays by applying the latest topological data analysis (TDA) methods. We observe that normal and abnormal images produce very distinct topological patterns for pneumonia and tuberculosis. By using cubical persistence, we capture these patterns and convert them into powerful feature vectors. By combining with standard ML methods, we obtain a computationally feasible and interpretable model. In our extensive experiments, our model Topo-CXR outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models in several benchmark datasets. Unlike most DL models, our proposed Topo-CXR model does not need any data augmentation or pre-processing steps and works perfectly on small datasets. Furthermore, our topological feature vectors can be easily integrated with any future ML and DL models to boost their performance and improve robustness.",No

to determine the hidden parameters of a natural system that will give rise to a
particular set of measurements. Recently many new approaches based upon deep
learning have arisen, generating promising results. We conceptualize these models
as different schemes for efficiently, but randomly, exploring the space of possible
inverse solutions. As a result, the accuracy of each approach should be evaluated
as a function of time rather than a single estimated solution, as is often done now.
Using this metric, we compare several state-of-the-art inverse modeling approaches
on four benchmark tasks: two existing tasks, a new 2-dimensional sinusoid task,
and a challenging modern task of meta-material design. Finally, inspired by our
conception of the inverse problem, we explore a simple solution that uses a deep
neural network as a surrogate (i.e., approximation) for the forward model, and
then uses backpropagation with respect to the model input to search for good
inverse solutions. Variations of this approach - which we term the neural adjoint

comprehensively on our benchmark. We find that the addition of a simple novel
loss term - which we term the boundary loss - dramatically improves the NA’s

20,icml_2020_937,On Lp-norm Robustness of Ensemble Decision Stumps and Trees.,"Recent papers have demonstrated that ensemble stumps and trees could be vulnerable to small input perturbations, so robustness verification and defense for those models have become an important research problem. However, due to the structure of decision trees, where each node makes decision purely based on one feature value, all the previous works only consider theℓ∞norm perturbation. To study robustness with respect to a generalℓpnorm perturbation, one has to consider the correlation between perturbations on different features, which has not been handled by previous algorithms. In this paper, we study the problem of robustness verification and certified defense with respect to generalℓpnorm perturbations for ensemble decision stumps and trees. For robustness verification of ensemble stumps, we prove that complete verification is NP-complete forp∈(0,∞)while polynomial time algorithms exist forp=0or∞. Forp∈(0,∞)we develop an efficient dynamic programming based algorithm for sound verification of ensemble stumps. For ensemble trees, we generalize the previous multi-level robustness verification algorithm toℓpnorm. We demonstrate the first certified defense method for training ensemble stumps and trees with respect toℓpnorm perturbations, and verify its effectiveness empirically on real datasets.",Yes

However, existing research on ARD primarily focuses on the overall robustness of student models, overlooking the crucial aspect ofrobust fairness. Specifically, these models may demonstrate strong robustness on some classes of data while exhibiting high vulnerability on other classes. Unfortunately, the ""buckets effect"" implies that the robustness of the deployed model depends on the classes with the lowest level of robustness. In this paper, we first investigate the inheritance of robust fairness during ARD and reveal that student models only partially inherit robust fairness from teacher models. We further validate this issue through fine-grained experiments with various model capacities and find that it may arise due to the gap in capacity between teacher and student models, as well as the existing methods treating each class equally during distillation. Based on these observations, we proposeFairAdversarialRobustnessDistillation (Fair-ARD), a novel framework for enhancing the robust fairness of student models by increasing the weights of difficult classes, and design a geometric perspective-based method to quantify the difficulty of different classes for determining the weights. Extensive experiments show that Fair-ARD surpasses both state-of-the-art ARD methods and existing robust fairness algorithms in terms of robust fairness (e.g., the worst-class robustness under AutoAttack is improved by at most 12.3\% and 5.3\% using ResNet18 on CIFAR10, respectively), while also slightly improving overall robustness.

23,nips_2022_80,Moderate-fitting as a Natural Backdoor Defender for Pre-trained Language Models.,"Part ofAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35  (NeurIPS 2022)Main Conference Track Biru Zhu, Yujia Qin, Ganqu Cui, Yangyi Chen, Weilin Zhao, Chong Fu, Yangdong Deng, Zhiyuan Liu, Jingang Wang, Wei Wu, Maosong Sun, Ming Gu  Despite the great success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in a large set of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there has been a growing concern about their security in real-world applications. Backdoor attack, which poisons a small number of training samples by inserting backdoor triggers, is a typical threat to security. Trained on the poisoned dataset, a victim model would perform normally on benign samples but predict the attacker-chosen label on samples containing pre-defined triggers. The vulnerability of PLMs under backdoor attacks has been proved with increasing evidence in the literature. In this paper, we present several simple yet effective training strategies that could effectively defend against such attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the possibility of backdoor-free adaptation for PLMs. Our motivation is based on the observation that, when trained on the poisoned dataset, the PLM's adaptation follows a strict order of two stages: (1) a moderate-fitting stage, where the model mainly learns the major features corresponding to the original task instead of subsidiary features of backdoor triggers, and (2) an overfitting stage, where both features are learned adequately. Therefore, if we could properly restrict the PLM's adaptation to the moderate-fitting stage, the model would neglect the backdoor triggers but still achieve satisfying performance on the original task. To this end, we design three methods to defend against backdoor attacks by reducing the model capacity, training epochs, and learning rate, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in defending against several representative NLP backdoor attacks. We also perform visualization-based analysis to attain a deeper understanding of how the model learns different features, and explore the effect of the poisoning ratio. Finally, we explore whether our methods could defend against backdoor attacks for the pre-trained CV model. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/thunlp/Moderate-fitting.

We propose in this paper a new white-box adversarial attack wrt thelp-norms forp∈{1,2,∞}aiming at finding the minimal perturbation necessary to change the class of a given input. It has an intuitive geometric meaning, yields quickly high quality results, minimizes the size of the perturbation (so that it returns the robust accuracy at every threshold with a single run).

25,icml_2023_1694,Actor-Critic Alignment for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning.,"Deep offline reinforcement learning has recently demonstrated considerable promises in leveraging offline datasets, providing high-quality models that significantly reduce the online interactions required for fine-tuning. However, such a benefit is often diminished due to the marked state-action distribution shift, which causes significant bootstrap error and wipes out the good initial policy. Existing solutions resort to constraining the policy shift or balancing the sample replay based on their online-ness. However, they require online estimation of distribution divergence or density ratio. To avoid such complications, we propose deviating from existing actor-critic approaches that directly transfer the state-action value functions. Instead, we post-process them by aligning with the offline learned policy, so that theQ-values for actionsoutsidethe offline policy are also tamed. As a result, the online fine-tuning can be simply performed as in the standard actor-critic algorithms. We show empirically that the proposed method improves the performance of the fine-tuned robotic agents on various simulated tasks.",No

32,icml_2022_163,Linearity Grafting: Relaxed Neuron Pruning Helps Certifiable Robustness.,"Certifiable robustness is a highly desirable property for adopting deep neural networks (DNNs) in safety-critical scenarios, but often demands tedious computations to establish. The main hurdle lies in the massive amount of non-linearity in large DNNs. To trade off the DNN expressiveness (which calls for more non-linearity) and robustness certification scalability (which prefers more linearity), we propose a novel solution to strategically manipulate neurons, by ""grafting"" appropriate levels of linearity. The core of our proposal is to first linearize insignificant ReLU neurons, to eliminate the non-linear components that are both redundant for DNN performance and harmful to its certification. We then optimize the associated slopes and intercepts of the replaced linear activations for restoring model performance while maintaining certifiability. Hence, typical neuron pruning could be viewed as a special case of grafting a linear function of the fixed zero slopes and intercept, that might overly restrict the network flexibility and sacrifice its performance.

The proposed attack method first adds random noise to an image to destroy the watermark and then reconstructs the image. This approach is flexible and can be instantiated with many existing image-denoising algorithms and pre-trained generative models such as diffusion models. Through formal proofs and extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that pixel-level invisible watermarks are vulnerable to this regeneration attack.Our results reveal that, across four different pixel-level watermarking schemes, the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing attack techniques, with lower detection rates and higher image quality.However, watermarks that keep the image semantically similar can be an alternative defense against our attacks.Our finding underscores the need for a shift in research/industry emphasis from invisible watermarks to semantic-preserving watermarks.

35,iccvw_2023_487,Adversarial Attacks Against Uncertainty Quantification.,"Machine-learning models can be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., carefully-crafted input perturbations that force models to output wrong predictions. While uncertainty quantification has been recently proposed to detect adversarial inputs, under the assumption that such attacks exhibit a higher prediction uncertainty than pristine data, it has been shown that adaptive attacks specifically aimed at reducing also the uncertainty estimate can easily bypass this defense mechanism. In this work, we focus on a different adversarial scenario in which the attacker is still interested in manipulating the uncertainty estimate, but regardless of the correctness of the prediction; in particular, the goal is to undermine the use of machine-learning models when their outputs are consumed by a downstream module or by a human operator. Following such direction, we: (i) design a threat model for attacks targeting uncertainty quantification; (ii) devise different attack strategies on conceptually different UQ techniques spanning for both classification and semantic segmentation problems; (iii) conduct a first complete and extensive analysis to compare the differences between some of the most employed UQ approaches under attack. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our attacks are more effective in manipulating uncertainty quantification measures than attacks aimed to also induce misclassifications.",Yes

The joint density of a CEBM decomposes into an intractable distribution over data and a tractable posterior over latent variables. CEBMs have similar use cases as variational autoencoders, in the sense that they learn an unsupervised mapping from data to latent variables. However, these models omit a generator network, which allows them to learn more flexible notions of similarity between data points.

We present SRATTA an attack relying only on aggregated models which, under realistic assumptions, (i) recovers data samples from the different clients, and (ii) groups data samples coming from the same client together. While sample recovery has already been explored in an FL setting, the ability to group samples per client, despite the use of SA, is novel. This poses a significant unforeseen security threat to FL and effectively breaks SA. We show that SRATTA is both theoretically grounded and can be used in practice on realistic models and datasets. We also propose counter-measures, and claim that clients should play an active role to guarantee their privacy during training.",Yes

Through reinforcement learning (RL), we have made massive strides towards solving tasks that have a single goal. However, in the multi-task domain, where an agent needs to reach multiple goals, the choice of training goals can largely affect sample efficiency. When biological agents learn, there is often an organized and meaningful order to which learning happens. Inspired by this, we propose setting up an automatic curriculum for goals that the agent needs to solve. Our key insight is that if we can sample goals at the frontier of the set of goals that an agent is able to reach, it will provide a significantly stronger learning signal compared to randomly sampled goals. To operationalize this idea, we introduce a goal proposal module that prioritizes goals that maximize the epistemic uncertainty of the Q-function of the policy. This simple technique samples goals that are neither too hard nor too easy for the agent to solve, hence enabling continual improvement.

It reduces the memory footprint and the computational cost at inference, facilitating the deployment of resource-hungry models. However, the parameter perturbations caused by this transformation result in behavioral disparities between the model before and after quantization. For example, a quantized model can misclassify some test-time samples that are otherwise classified correctly. It is not known whether such differences lead to a new security vulnerability. We hypothesize that an adversary may control this disparity to introduce specific behaviors that activate upon quantization. To study this hypothesis, we weaponize quantization-aware training and propose a new training framework to implement adversarial quantization outcomes. Following this framework, we present three attacks we carry out with quantization: (i) an indiscriminate attack for significant accuracy loss; (ii) a targeted attack against specific samples; and (iii) a backdoor attack for controlling the model with an input trigger. We further show that a single compromised model defeats multiple quantization schemes, including robust quantization techniques. Moreover, in a federated learning scenario, we demonstrate that a set of malicious participants who conspire can inject our quantization-activated backdoor. Lastly, we discuss potential counter-measures and show that only re-training consistently removes the attack artifacts.

Recently, inpainting started being used for watermark removal, raising concerns. In this paper we study how to manipulate it using our markpainting technique. First, we show how an image owner with access to an inpainting model can augment their image in such a way that any attempt to edit it using that model will add arbitrary visible information. We find that we can target multiple different models simultaneously with our technique. This can be designed to reconstitute a watermark if the editor had been trying to remove it. Second, we show that our markpainting technique is transferable to models that have different architectures or were trained on different datasets, so watermarks created using it are difficult for adversaries to remove. Markpainting is novel and can be used as a manipulation alarm that becomes visible in the event of inpainting. Source code is available at: https://github.com/iliaishacked/markpainting.",Yes

We find distinct geometric signatures for each type of network, revealing different mechanisms for achieving robust representations. Next, we generalize these results to the auditory domain, showing that neural stochasticity also makes auditory models more robust to adversarial perturbations.

Patch-based attacks by contrast are physically realizable, yet most work has focused on 2D domain with recent forays into 3D. Characterizing the robustness properties of patch attacks and their invariance to 3D pose is important, yet not fully elucidated, and is the focus of this paper. To this end, several contributions are made here: A) we develop a new metric called mean Attack Success over Transformations (mAST) to evaluate patch attack robustness and invariance; and B), we systematically assess robustness of patch attacks to 3D position and orientation for various conditions; in particular, we conduct a sensitivity analysis which provides important qualitative insights into attack effectiveness as a function of the 3D pose of a patch relative to the camera (rotation, translation) and sets forth some properties for patch attack 3D invariance; and C), we draw novel qualitative conclusions including: 1) we demonstrate that for some 3D transformations, namely rotation and loom, increasing the training distribution support yields an increase in patch success over the full range at test time. 2) We provide new insights into the existence of a fundamental cutoff limit in patch attack effectiveness that depends on the extent of out-of-plane rotation angles.

45,icml_2022_572,CerDEQ: Certifiable Deep Equilibrium Model.,"Recently, certifiable robust training methods via bound propagation have been proposed for training neural networks with certifiable robustness guarantees. However, no neural architectures with regular convolution and linear layers perform better in the certifiable training than the plain CNNs, since the output bounds for the deep explicit models increase quickly as their depth increases. And such a phenomenon significantly hinders certifiable training. Meanwhile, the Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) is more representative and robust due to their equivalent infinite depth and controllable global Lipschitz. But no work has been proposed to explore whether DEQ can show advantages in certified training. In this work, we aim to tackle the problem of DEQ’s certified training. To obtain the output bound based on the bound propagation scheme in the implicit model, we first involve the adjoint DEQ for bound approximation. Furthermore, we also use the weight orthogonalization method and other tricks specified for DEQ to stabilize the certifiable training. With our approach, we can obtain the certifiable DEQ called CerDEQ.

The SCSG-HT uses batch gradients where batch size is pre-determined by the desirable precision tolerance rather than full gradients to reduce the variance in stochastic gradients. It also employs the geometric distribution to determine the number of loops per epoch. We prove that, similar to the latest methods based on stochastic gradient descent or stochastic variance reduction methods, SCSG-HT enjoys a linear convergence rate. However, SCSG-HT now has a strong guarantee to recover the optimal sparse estimator. The computational complexity of SCSG-HT is independent of sample sizenwhennis larger than 1/ε, which enhances the scalability to massive-scale problems. Empirical results demonstrate that SCSG-HT outperforms several competitors and decreases the objective value the most with the same computational costs.",No

Early XAI methods produced visual explanations, whereas more recent techniques generate multimodal explanations that include textual information and visual representations. Visual XAI methods have been shown to be vulnerable to white-box and gray-box adversarial attacks, with an attacker having full or partial knowledge of and access to the target system. As the vulnerabilities of multimodal XAI models have not been examined, in this paper we assess for the first time the robustness to black-box attacks of the natural language explanations generated by a self-rationalizing image-based activity recognition model. We generate unrestricted, spatially variant perturbations that disrupt the association between the predictions and the corresponding explanations to mislead the model into generating unfaithful explanations. We show that we can create adversarial images that manipulate the explanations of an activity recognition model by having access only to its final output.",Yes

We also curate two separate datasets, ImageNet-AH with artificially generated Gaussian specular highlights and ImageNet-PT by flashing natural specular highlights on printed images, both demonstrating significant degradations in the performance of the classifiers. We note around 20% drop in the model prediction accuracy with artificial specular highlights and around 35% accuracy drop in torch-highlighted printed images. These drops indeed question the robustness and reliability of modern-day image classifiers. We also find that finetuning these classifiers with specular images does not improve the prediction performance enough. To understand the reason, we finally do an activation mapping analysis and examine the network attention areas in images with and without highlights. We find that specular highlights shift the attention of models which makes fine-tuning ineffective, eventually broadly leading to performance drops.",Yes
50,iccvw_2023_326,GANDiffFace: Controllable Generation of Synthetic Datasets for Face Recognition with Realistic Variations.,"Face recognition systems have significantly advanced in recent years, driven by the availability of large-scale datasets. However, several issues have recently came up, including privacy concerns that have led to the discontinuation of well-established public datasets. Synthetic datasets have emerged as a solution, even though current synthesis methods present other drawbacks such as limited intraclass variations, lack of realism, and unfair representation of demographic groups. This study introduces GAN-DiffFace, a novel framework for the generation of synthetic datasets for face recognition that combines the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models to overcome the limitations of existing synthetic datasets. In GANDiffFace, we first propose the use of GANs to synthesize highly realistic identities and meet target demographic distributions. Subsequently, we fine-tune Diffusion models with the images generated with GANs, synthesizing multiple images of the same identity with a variety of accessories, poses, expressions, and contexts. We generate multiple synthetic datasets by changing GANDiffFace settings, and compare their mated and non-mated score distributions with the distributions provided by popular real-world datasets for face recognition, i.e. VGG2 and IJB-C. Our results show the feasibility of the proposed GANDiffFace, in particular the use of Diffusion models to enhance the (limited) intra-class variations provided by GANs towards the level of real-world datasets.",No
51,aaai_2020_1609,Learning Attentive Pairwise Interaction for Fine-Grained Classification.,"Fine-grained classification is a challenging problem, due to subtle differences among highly-confused categories. Most approaches address this difficulty by learning discriminative representation of individual input image. On the other hand, humans can effectively identify contrastive clues by comparing image pairs. Inspired by this fact, this paper proposes a simple but effective Attentive Pairwise Interaction Network (API-Net), which can progressively recognize a pair of fine-grained images by interaction. Specifically, API-Net first learns a mutual feature vector to capture semantic differences in the input pair. It then compares this mutual vector with individual vectors to generate gates for each input image. These distinct gate vectors inherit mutual context on semantic differences, which allow API-Net to attentively capture contrastive clues by pairwise interaction between two images. Additionally, we train API-Net in an end-to-end manner with a score ranking regularization, which can further generalize API-Net by taking feature priorities into account. We conduct extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks in fine-grained classification. API-Net outperforms the recent SOTA methods, i.e., CUB-200-2011 (90.0%), Aircraft (93.9%), Stanford Cars (95.3%), Stanford Dogs (90.3%), and NABirds (88.1%).",No

54,iccvw_2023_4,DeepCut: Unsupervised Segmentation using Graph Neural Networks Clustering.,"Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Data annotation for training supervised methods can be labor-intensive, motivating unsupervised methods. Current approaches often rely on extracting deep features from pre-trained networks to construct a graph, and classical clustering methods like k-means and normalized-cuts are then applied as a post-processing step. However, this approach reduces the high-dimensional information encoded in the features to pair-wise scalar affinities. To address this limitation, this study introduces a lightweight Graph Neural Network (GNN) to replace classical clustering methods while optimizing for the same clustering objective function. Unlike existing methods, our GNN takes both the pair-wise affinities between local image features and the raw features as input. This direct connection between the raw features and the clustering objective enables us to implicitly perform classification of the clusters between different graphs, resulting in part semantic segmentation without the need for additional post-processing steps. We demonstrate how classical clustering objectives can be formulated as self-supervised loss functions for training an image segmentation GNN. Furthermore, we employ the Correlation-Clustering (CC) objective to perform clustering without defining the number of clusters, allowing for k-less clustering. We apply the proposed method for object localization, segmentation, and semantic part segmentation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks1.",No

59,icml_2022_811,Benchmarking and Analyzing Point Cloud Classification under Corruptions.,"3D perception, especially point cloud classification, has achieved substantial progress. However, in real-world deployment, point cloud corruptions are inevitable due to the scene complexity, sensor inaccuracy, and processing imprecision. In this work, we aim to rigorously benchmark and analyze point cloud classification under corruptions. To conduct a systematic investigation, we first provide a taxonomy of common 3D corruptions and identify the atomic corruptions. Then, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on a wide range of representative point cloud models to understand their robustness and generalizability. Our benchmark results show that although point cloud classification performance improves over time, the state-of-the-art methods are on the verge of being less robust. Based on the obtained observations, we propose several effective techniques to enhance point cloud classifier robustness. We hope our comprehensive benchmark, in-depth analysis, and proposed techniques could spark future research in robust 3D perception.",Yes

Li  It has become cognitive inertia to employ cross-entropy loss function in classification related tasks. In the untargeted attacks on graph structure, the gradients derived from the attack objective are the attacker's basis for evaluating a perturbation scheme. Previous methods use negative cross-entropy loss as the attack objective in attacking node-level classification models. However, the suitability of the cross-entropy function for constructing the untargeted attack objective has yet been discussed in previous works. This paper argues about the previous unreasonable attack objective from the perspective of budget allocation. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that negative cross-entropy tends to produce more significant gradients from nodes with lower confidence in the labeled classes, even if the predicted classes of these nodes have been misled. To free up these inefficient attack budgets, we propose a simple attack model for untargeted attacks on graph structure based on a novel attack objective which generates unweighted gradients on graph structures that are not affected by the node confidence. By conducting experiments in gray-box poisoning attack scenarios, we demonstrate that a reasonable budget allocation can significantly improve the effectiveness of gradient-based edge perturbations without any extra hyper-parameter.

The baseline policy can arise from demonstration data or a teacher agent and may provide useful cues for learning, but it might also be sub-optimal for the task at hand, and is not guaranteed to satisfy the specified constraints, which might encode safety, fairness or other application-specific requirements. In order to safely learn from baseline policies, we propose an iterative policy optimization algorithm that alternates between maximizing expected return on the task, minimizing distance to the baseline policy, and projecting the policy onto the constraint-satisfying set. We analyze our algorithm theoretically and provide a finite-time convergence guarantee. In our experiments on five different control tasks, our algorithm consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 10 times fewer constraint violations and 40% higher reward on average.",No

Most existing methods estimate the density ratio between the source- and target-domain label distributions by density matching. However, these methods are either computationally infeasible for large-scale data or restricted to shift correction for discrete labels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Label Transformation Framework (LTF) for correcting label shift, which implicitly models the shift ofPYand the conditional distributionPX|Yusing neural networks. Thanks to the flexibility of deep networks, our framework can handle continuous, discrete, and even multi-dimensional labels in a unified way and is scalable to large data. Moreover, for high dimensionalX, such as images, we find that the redundant information inXseverely degrades the estimation accuracy. To remedy this issue, we propose to match the distribution implied by our generative model and the target-domain distribution in a low-dimensional feature space that discards information irrelevant toY.

However, a crucial challenge prohibits their use in practice. BNNs require a large number of predictions to produce reliable results, leading to a significant increase in computational cost. To alleviate this issue, we propose spatial smoothing, a method that ensembles neighboring feature map points of convolutional neural networks. By simply adding a few blur layers to the models, we empirically show that spatial smoothing improves accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and robustness of BNNs across a whole range of ensemble sizes. In particular, BNNs incorporating spatial smoothing achieve high predictive performance merely with a handful of ensembles. Moreover, this method also can be applied to canonical deterministic neural networks to improve the performances. A number of evidences suggest that the improvements can be attributed to the stabilized feature maps and the smoothing of the loss landscape. In addition, we provide a fundamental explanation for prior works {—} namely, global average pooling, pre-activation, and ReLU6 {—} by addressing them as special cases of spatial smoothing. These not only enhance accuracy, but also improve uncertainty estimation and robustness by making the loss landscape smoother in the same manner as spatial smoothing.

75,aaai_2020_123,Actor Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Neural Malware Control.,"In addition to using signatures, antimalware products also detect malicious attacks by evaluating unknown files in an emulated environment,i.e.sandbox, prior to execution on a computer's native operating system. During emulation, a file cannot be scanned indefinitely, and antimalware engines often set the number of instructions to be executed based on a set of heuristics. These heuristics only make the decision of when to halt emulation using partial information leading to the execution of the file for either too many or too few instructions. Also this method is vulnerable if the attackers learn this set of heuristics. Recent research uses a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model employing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn when to halt the emulation of a file. In this paper, we propose a new DRL-based system which instead employs a modified actor critic (AC) framework for the emulation halting task. This AC model dynamically predicts the best time to halt the file's execution based on a sequence of system API calls. Compared to the earlier models, the new model is capable of handling adversarial attacks by simulating their behaviors using the critic model. The new AC model demonstrates much better performance than both the DQN model and antimalware engine's heuristics. In terms of execution speed (evaluated by the halting decision), the new model halts the execution of unknown files by up to 2.5% earlier than the DQN model and 93.6% earlier than the heuristics. For the task of detecting malicious files, the proposed AC model increases the true positive rate by 9.9% from 69.5% to 76.4% at a false positive rate of 1% compared to the DQN model, and by 83.4% from 41.2% to 76.4% at a false positive rate of 1% compared to a recently proposed LSTM model.",Yes
76,iccvw_2021_298,Is First Person Vision Challenging for Object Tracking?,"Understanding human-object interactions is fundamental in First Person Vision (FPV). Tracking algorithms which follow the objects manipulated by the camera wearer can provide useful cues to effectively model such interactions. Visual tracking solutions available in the computer vision literature have significantly improved their performance in the last years for a large variety of target objects and tracking scenarios. However, despite a few previous attempts to exploit trackers in FPV applications, a methodical analysis of the performance of state-of-the-art trackers in this domain is still missing. In this paper, we fill the gap by presenting the first systematic study of object tracking in FPV. Our study extensively analyses the performance of recent visual trackers and baseline FPV trackers with respect to different aspects and considering a new performance measure. This is achieved through TREK-150, a novel benchmark dataset composed of 150 densely annotated video sequences. Our results show that object tracking in FPV is challenging, which suggests that more research efforts should be devoted to this problem so that tracking could benefit FPV tasks.",No

78,aaai_2020_620,Adversarial Dynamic Shapelet Networks.,"Shapelets are discriminative subsequences for time series classification. Recently, learning time-series shapelets (LTS) was proposed to learn shapelets by gradient descent directly. Although learning-based shapelet methods achieve better results than previous methods, they still have two shortcomings. First, the learned shapelets are fixed after training and cannot adapt to time series with deformations at the testing phase. Second, the shapelets learned by back-propagation may not be similar to any real subsequences, which is contrary to the original intention of shapelets and reduces model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel shapelet learning model called Adversarial Dynamic Shapelet Networks (ADSNs). An adversarial training strategy is employed to prevent the generated shapelets from diverging from the actual subsequences of a time series. During inference, a shapelet generator produces sample-specific shapelets, and a dynamic shapelet transformation uses the generated shapelets to extract discriminative features. Thus, ADSN can dynamically generate shapelets that are similar to the real subsequences rather than having arbitrary shapes. The proposed model has high modeling flexibility while retaining the interpretability of shapelet-based methods. Experiments conducted on extensive time series data sets show that ADSN is state-of-the-art compared to existing shapelet-based methods. The visualization analysis also shows the effectiveness of dynamic shapelet generation and adversarial training.",Yes

The adversary observes only the points of the queries but not the feedback from the oracle.

In the classical setting when noise has finite variance, an optimal algorithm, built upon the batched accelerated gradient method, was proposed in (Gasnikov et. al., 2022). This optimality is defined in terms of iteration and oracle complexity, as well as the maximal admissible level of adversarial noise. However, the assumption of finite variance is burdensome and it might not hold in many practical scenarios. To address this, we demonstrate how to adapt a refined clipped version of the accelerated gradient (Stochastic Similar Triangles) method from (Sadiev et al., 2023) for a two-point zero-order oracle. This adaptation entails extending the batching technique to accommodate infinite variance — a non-trivial task that stands as a distinct contribution of this paper.

82,icml_2023_225,Tight Certification of Adversarially Trained Neural Networks via Nonconvex Low-Rank Semidefinite Relaxations.,"Adversarial training is well-known to produce high-quality neural network models that are empirically robust against adversarial perturbations. Nevertheless, once a model has been adversarially trained, one often desires a certification that the model is truly robust against all future attacks. Unfortunately, when faced with adversarially trained models, all existing approaches have significant trouble making certifications that are strong enough to be practically useful. Linear programming (LP) techniques in particular face a “convex relaxation barrier” that prevent them from making high-quality certifications, even after refinement with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and branch-and-bound (BnB) techniques. In this paper, we propose a nonconvex certification technique, based on a low-rank restriction of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. The nonconvex relaxation makes strong certifications comparable to much more expensive SDP methods, while optimizing over dramatically fewer variables comparable to much weaker LP methods. Despite nonconvexity, we show how off-the-shelf local optimization algorithms can be used to achieve and to certify global optimality in polynomial time. Our experiments find that the nonconvex relaxation almost completely closes the gap towards exact certification of adversarially trained models.",Yes
83,icml_2021_498,"""Hey, that's not an ODE"": Faster ODE Adjoints via Seminorms.","Neural differential equations may be trained by backpropagating gradients via the adjoint method, which is another differential equation typically solved using an adaptive-step-size numerical differential equation solver. A proposed step is accepted if its error, \emph{relative to some norm}, is sufficiently small; else it is rejected, the step is shrunk, and the process is repeated. Here, we demonstrate that the particular structure of the adjoint equations makes the usual choices of norm (such asL2) unnecessarily stringent. By replacing it with a more appropriate (semi)norm, fewer steps are unnecessarily rejected and the backpropagation is made faster. This requires only minor code modifications. Experiments on a wide range of tasks—including time series, generative modeling, and physical control—demonstrate a median improvement of 40% fewer function evaluations. On some problems we see as much as 62% fewer function evaluations, so that the overall training time is roughly halved.",No

85,icml_2021_1071,Graph Neural Networks Inspired by Classical Iterative Algorithms.,"Despite the recent success of graph neural networks (GNN), common architectures often exhibit significant limitations, including sensitivity to oversmoothing, long-range dependencies, and spurious edges, e.g., as can occur as a result of graph heterophily or adversarial attacks. To at least partially address these issues within a simple transparent framework, we consider a new family of GNN layers designed to mimic and integrate the update rules of two classical iterative algorithms, namely, proximal gradient descent and iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS). The former defines an extensible base GNN architecture that is immune to oversmoothing while nonetheless capturing long-range dependencies by allowing arbitrary propagation steps. In contrast, the latter produces a novel attention mechanism that is explicitly anchored to an underlying end-to-end energy function, contributing stability with respect to edge uncertainty. When combined we obtain an extremely simple yet robust model that we evaluate across disparate scenarios including standardized benchmarks, adversarially-perturbated graphs, graphs with heterophily, and graphs involving long-range dependencies. In doing so, we compare against SOTA GNN approaches that have been explicitly designed for the respective task, achieving competitive or superior node classification accuracy.

The verification of such algorithms is crucial for safe and efficient underwater exploration and intervention operations. Ground truth data play an important role in evaluating vision algorithms. However, obtaining ground truth from real underwater environments is in general very hard, if possible at all.In a synthetic underwater 3D environment, however, (nearly) all parameters are known and controllable, and ground truth data can be absolutely accurate in terms of geometry. In this paper, we present the

Pose sequences are created by first defining waypoints for the simulated underwater vehicle which are expanded into a smooth vehicle course sampled at IMU data rate (200 Hz). This expansion uses a vehicle dynamics model and a discrete-time controller algorithm that simulates the sequential following of the waypoints.The scenes are rendered using the raytracing method, which generates realistic images, integrating direct light, and indirect volumetric scattering.
