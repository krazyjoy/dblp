uss_2022_248,Lend Me Your Ear: Passive Remote Physical Side Channels on PCs.,"No. The given abstract is related to side-channel attacks involving electromagnetic leakage and unintended data capture, not adversarial attacks on machine learning systems."
uss_2022_249,Stalloris: RPKI Downgrade Attack.,"No. The abstract describes security vulnerabilities in the RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) systems, which are related to network security rather than adversarial machine learning."
uss_2022_250,XDRI Attacks - and - How to Enhance Resilience of Residential Routers.,"No, the abstract is not related to AML as it focuses on security vulnerabilities and cache poisoning attacks in residential routers, which are not specific to machine learning systems."
uss_2022_251,V'CER: Efficient Certificate Validation in Constrained Networks.,"No, the abstract is not related to AML. It focuses on the problem of trust establishment and device revocation in constrained networks, which is more related to network security rather than adversarial machine learning."
uss_2022_252,Themis: Accelerating the Detection of Route Origin Hijacking by Distinguishing Legitimate and Illegitimate MOAS.,"No, the abstract is related to addressing route hijacking security issues in Internet routing rather than focusing on adversarial attacks or defenses within a machine learning context."
uss_2022_253,ML-Doctor: Holistic Risk Assessment of Inference Attacks Against Machine Learning Models.,"Yes, the abstract is related to AML because it discusses various inference attacks on machine learning models, which are a category of adversarial attacks aimed at extracting sensitive information."
uss_2022_254,Inference Attacks Against Graph Neural Networks.,"Yes, this abstract is related to AML because it discusses inference attacks on graph embeddings, which aim to exploit machine learning model outputs to gain unauthorized insights about the underlying data, and the abstract also proposes a defense mechanism to counteract these attacks."
uss_2022_255,Membership Inference Attacks and Defenses in Neural Network Pruning.,"Yes, the abstract is related to AML because it mentions privacy risks associated with neural network pruning, which could potentially be exploited through adversarial attacks like inference attacks."
uss_2022_256,Are Your Sensitive Attributes Private? Novel Model Inversion Attribute Inference Attacks on Classification Models.,"Yes. The abstract is related to AML because it discusses model inversion attacks, a type of adversarial attack aimed at inferring sensitive information from machine learning models."
